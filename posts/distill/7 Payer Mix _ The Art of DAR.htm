    7.1 Overview of Payer Mix// <#overview-of-payer-mix>

Payer mix is defined as the percentage of revenue coming from each type
of contracted payer such as government-based insurance, commercial
insurance, and self-paying individuals for a facility or provider.
Because payers will pay for services at different rates, a shift in your
patient population to a payer who generally pays less can have a
substantial impact on your practice revenues. Monitor on a regular basis
the percentage of services associated with each of your payers and
verify a good payer mix that represents a strong revenue stream for the
practice. Having a well-balanced mix decreases the control any one payer
will have on your practice.

Payer mix should be monitored and reviewed in the interest of developing
a marketing strategy to derive a different payer mix if need be.
Marketing manifests itself in various ways for medical practices in the
current payer market, including marketing strictly to third-party payers
and, in some instances, marketing directly to business/industry or the
patient.


    7.2 Payer Mix Ratio// <#payer-mix-ratio>

A detailed understanding of a practice’s payer mix is essential to
achieving a comprehensive analysis of the entity’s broader financial
stability, as well as being critical to ongoing financial management on
behalf of the practice’s leadership. A typical payer mix ratio is based
on Net Charges for a payer, divided by Total Net Charges for the practice:


Net Charges for Payer ATotal Net Charges=Payer Mix Ratio
Net Charges for Payer ATotal Net Charges=Payer Mix Ratio


For instance, if a practice’s Medicare charges represent $355,000 of
$1,200,000 in total net charges, the practice’s Medicare payer mix would
be calculated as follows:

350,0001,200,000=29%
350,0001,200,000=29%


This says that the practice’s payer mix is composed of 29% Medicare
coverage. While knowing the Medicare payer mix is certainly important,
knowing how the remaining 71% of the practice’s payer mix is allocated
makes that ratio even more relevant and actionable.

As such, it is beneficial for practices to maintain a payer mix report
on their dashboard to follow the payer mix among all of the practice’s
payers on a monthly basis, as well as tracking the fluctuations of their
payer mix on a rolling basis.


      7.2.1 Payer Mix Report Example// <#payer-mix-report-example>

The following table and chart are examples of reports that should be
broken down even further to show monthly performance, day-to-day
variation in payer mix (which is also relevant when analyzing Accounts
Receivable by payer.) Further, these reports can show payer mix by
provider, to determine payer concentration for each provider as well as
AR by payer.

The following is an example of a simple bar chart comparing payer mix by
payer groups. Payer groups are maintained like procedure categories. For
example, the payer group Medicare might contain traditional Medicare,
Railroad Medicare, or Medicare Advantage plans. It is helpful to
understand changes in payer mix over time. The practice’s largest payer
is almost four percentage points larger year-to-date compared to the
prior year. If this is a better payer for the practice, that could be
wonderful news. If this payer has higher deductibles to collect and more
denials to appeal, the increase may not be such good news. The filters
in the dashboard can help management understand whether this change in
payer mix is especially relevant for a certain location, procedure
group, or department in the practice.


    7.3 Relationship to Provider Compensation// <#relationship-to-
    provider-compensation>

The practice’s payer mix is often used in determining an appropriate
compensation plan. For example, in hospital employment, a poor payer mix
composed of a high level of Medicaid and self-pay patients may indicate
that a collections-type model is not as viable. Thus, the focus would
turn to wRVUs or some other metric. In private practice, the payer mix
of various physicians is compared to determine whether they all have
similar payer mixes. If this is not the case, it may indicate that some
equilibrium is needed within the model to shift some of the payer risk
to the practice as a whole instead of a single physician incurring the
poor payer mix. If the model is the individual productivity-based model,
a poor payer mix is detrimental to a physician.


      7.3.1 Receipts Per Work RVU// <#receipts-per-work-rvu>

The idea of working harder for less is captured in the practice’s
receipts per work RVU measure. The chief executive officer uses the
metric to compare procedures and payers across providers. A relatively
new addition to the dashboard is a series of charts like the following
line chart that trend receipts per wRVU over time. The dashboard
includes several similar charts that analyze groups of five procedure
categories.

Since receipts per work RVU is such an important metric for this
practice, the dashboard also includes similar charts trending receipts
and work RVUs separately for each procedure category. Charting receipts
and work RVUs separately makes it easier to explain differences in the
measure over time. In this case, the practice does not match the month
receipts were collected to the month that the work RVUs were rendered.

Other practices match charges and receipts in the same month and trend
that data. Consider an example of a service rendered in April. The
practice may receive a copayment in April, a primary insurance payment
in May, and a secondary insurance payment in June. It will likely take
several months to record most of the revenues against April charges.
This lag in payments received against charges introduces a delay before
the trend matching charges and receipts is available for the month.
Though matching charges against receipts does have a lag, the advantage
is that the receipts are measured against the charges that generated the
receipts.


      7.3.2 Compensation Per wRVU Ratio// <#compensation-per-wrvu-ratio>

This ratio is often referred to as the /conversion factor/ and is a key
variable in wRVU productivity models. It is also used to gauge the
appropriateness of a physician’s compensation in relation to benchmark
data. For example, in private practice, assessing the compensation per
wRVU ratio would indicate whether the physician was receiving a proper
level of compensation at the respective level of productivity. If this
is not the case, it would indicate that changes are likely necessary
within the practice to realize more compensation for the same level of
productivity. This would involve cost reductions, negotiating better
payer contracts, etc. In a hospital employment setting, a higher
conversion factor could indicate that a model may not be deemed to be
within fair market value limitations. This is because it could be
assumed that, for the physician’s level of productivity, he or she was
receiving too much compensation.


      7.3.3 Compensation to Collections// <#compensation-to-collections>

This ratio is similar to the above but it replaces wRVUs with
collections. This ratio is very important in private practice, as it
allows the practice to understand how much of each dollar received in
collections gets taken home as cash compensation. A high compensation to
collections ratio would indicate that the practice is good at managing
its overhead. This ratio is also used in hospital employment settings,
but to a lesser degree in terms of determining appropriate compensation
(unless the model used is a percentage of collections model.) This
places much more focus on wRVU-related metrics.


    7.4 Payer Mix by Allowed Charges// <#payer-mix-by-allowed-charges>

Practices can look at the percentage of their charges and allowed
amounts per payer to determine their payer mix. If practices bill the
same [[Fee schedule]] to all payers, they can monitor whether payers
have gained or lost market share. If practices already know their
preferred or less desirable contracts, recognizing shifts in the market
will alert business managers to take necessary actions. It can also be
helpful to look at payer mix by provider or specialty.

Another way to look at payer mix is to compare the billed charges to the
allowed amount by payer:

Primary Insurance 	% of Billed Charges 	% of Allowed Charges
Payer 1 	15.1% 	16.4%
Payer 2 	39.9% 	42.2%
Payer 3 	5.2% 	5.4%
Payer 4 	1.1% 	0.9%
Payer 5 	14.9% 	12.7%
Payer 6 	23.8% 	22.2%
Total 	100.0% 	100.0%

Payers like Payer 1 and 2 have a higher percentage of allowed charges
than billed charges, indicating favorable contracts as compared to other
payers. Payer 5, on the other hand, represents 14.9% of billed charges
but only 12.7% of the allowed amounts, indicating a less favorable contract.

This analysis compares allowed amounts, not actual collections. It might
be that a payer has a different demographic (more or less compliant
patients, for example) or has sold high-deductible plans to patients
unable to meet that obligation. Tracking bad debt and collections
adjustments by the patients’ primary insurance can identify these payers.

Payer mix can also be evaluated over time to track and understand
changes. For example, practices may have seen an increase in self-pay
patients. To smooth out month-to-month fluctuations in the data, this
payer mix uses a three-month moving average to compare last year’s payer
mix to the current year. A similar analysis could be done by provider,
facility, specialty, and other fields in the reimbursement dataset. The
table below shows the percentage of allowed charges in the current-year
column and compares that payer mix to the prior year’s payer mix. This
data might also be displayed differently showing a five-year trend with
a sparkline.^7

Payer 	Current Year 	Prior Year
Payer 1 	16.4% 	15.9%
Payer 2 	42.4% 	39.5%
Payer 3 	5.4% 	7.9%
Payer 4 	0.9% 	0.8%
Payer 5 	12.7% 	12.8%
Payer 6 	22.2% 	23.1%


    7.5 Percentage of Medicare Reimbursement Charted against RVU
    Volume// <#percentage-of-medicare-reimbursement-charted-against-rvu-
    volume>

Another part of a practice’s contracting strategy may be to use Medicare
reimbursement as a baseline and then compare reimbursement as a
percentage of Medicare:


Percentage of Reimbursement Compared to RVU Volume.

The red diagonal line represents the desired minimum average payment per
RVU based on contracted rates as a percentage of Medicare (plotted on
the y-axis) and the volume of RVUs for that payer as measured in RVUs
(plotted on the x-axis). The red line is essentially the practice’s
contracting strategy, which is to offer the best rates (lowest
percentage of Medicare rates) to the payers purchasing the highest
volume amount of services (as measured in RVUs) from the practice.

Notice how Payers B and C both purchase a little less than 6,000 RVUs
from this practice. Both payers are below the red line, especially Payer
C. According to the pricing policy, payers who purchase 6,000 RVUs per
year from the practice should pay about 135% of Medicare rates, but
Payer C is only paying about 113%. Payer E is on the line, so their
reimbursement rates are in lone with the volume of services purchased
from the practice. Payers A and D are above the pricing policy line and
are good contracts for the practice.

This model can be adjusted to take into account many reimbursement
models, such as pay for performance, capitation, withholds, and bonuses.
Another benchmark to chart on the y-axis might be the survey data
regarding average payment per RVU from MGMA-ACMPE for the specialty,
practice size, and region. Those reimbursement percentages can then be
compared to RVU volume to analyze reimbursement by payer in context with
the volume of patients per payer.
