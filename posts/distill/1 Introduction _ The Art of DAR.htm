------------------------------------------------------------------------


    1.1 Healthcare Economic Model// <#healthcare-economic-model>

One of the most telling measurements indicating the efficiency of a
medical practice’s financial management is the collection ratio.
Although variations of this ration are used in a variety of businesses,
its determinants are unique in healthcare service entities because of
the fundamental economics of their business model.

For companies that sell their products/services directly to consumers,
this measurement is typically different because they are often paid on
an immediate fee-for-service basis (i.e., consumers render at point of
service.) For business-to-business companies, this can be more important
because fees for services/products rendered in this model are typically
invoiced, and most businesses remit payments on a monthly basis.
Therefore, it can take 30 or more days for a company to receive payment
for its services or products from another business. If that number
increases dramatically, this could mean the business is having more
difficult time collecting payment from its customers. The reason could
range from the basic timing of cash flow fluctuations to liquidity and/
or insolvency issues, the latter of which could easily result in the
original business never receiving any payment for its services or
products. All of this is critical when considering that business’
financial health, in addition to the fact that managers within that
business must incorporate these trends into the budgeting and capital
planning processes.

The collection ratio for a medical practice, however, goes beyond the
basic scenario outlined above, because in addition to the general
fluctuations in the business’ cash flows, there is an additional
variable that most businesses do not have to consider, and that is the
practice’s contractual adjustments.

Contractual Adjustments Although medical practices are more consumer-
centered business models in nature, the presence of third-party
reimbursement and contractual pricing adjustments essentially means that
medical practices must operate in a business-to-business revenue model
while the services model is business-to-consumer. This can double a
practice’s financial stress, in that the timing of billing and
collections can create cash flow challenges, in addition to the general
difference between actual income derived after contractual adjustments.

Contractual adjustments refers to the values for certain services
negotiated between a medical provider (individual or entity) and third
party payers. Simply put, although a physician may bill a specific
amount (X) for certain services or procedures, which in theory have a
certain value attached, the third party payers with which the provider
contracts will only actually pay a portion of that amount (X - n).

There is a fundamental economic inefficiency in this model, in that
prices for health care services are not set by market forces (i.e.,
supply and demand) as they typically are in an open-market system.
Instead, prices are set by individual contractual arrangements, which
are negotiated on an even further individual basis, ultimately resulting
in no real demand or pricing curve. The impact of this key inefficiency
in the health care economic pricing model is a much larger issue that
extends beyond the scope of this discussion; however, this concept is
critical in understanding the basic profitability and degree of
financial stability for any health care service business where third
party payer contracts are involved.

Ultimately, a practice’s collection ratio will typically indicate how
well it is collecting for services rendered - or, from the more
pessimistic perspective, how significant the gap is between the value of
services rendered and the actual amount paid for the same services.
Collection ratios are going to range significantly among different types
of practices, based on size, specialty, region, and demographic makeup
of the practice’s patient base (i.e., payer mix.) Practices involving
specialties where there is substantial reimbursement from Medicare and
certain private insurance payers continue to watch the gap between
charges and collections grow, ultimately depressing these businesses’
margins severely. Conversely, some practices have evolved to find new
ways to expand profitability and maintain margins, despite reimbursement
pressure. While it is unclear how collection ratios will evolve for
practices in the long run, one thing that is certain is the need for
practices to find new methods of sustaining profitability. Although
there is a difference in timing of the charges being collected today
versus those placed on the books at a later date, a collection ratio
clearly presents a percentage of such performance relative to adjusted
charges.


    1.2 Accounts Receivable// <#accounts-receivable>

Accounts Receivable (AR) represents money owed to the healthcare
practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The Accounts Receivable
cycle begins with the delivery of service and continues until payment
for the service is reconciled to a zero balance.

Accounts Receivable management is a system that assists providers in the
collection of the reimbursement for services rendered. The functions of
Accounts Receivable management include insurance verification, insurance
eligibility, prior authorization, billing and claims submission, posting
payments, and collections.

The Accounts Receivable department manages the amounts owed to a
facility by patients who received services but whose payments will be
made at a later date by the patients or guarantors or their third-party
payers. After the claim is submitted to a TPP^1 for reimbursement, the
time allowed to remit a payment to Accounts Receivable begins. Typical
performance statistics maintained by the accounts receivable department
include Days in AR and Aging of Accounts.

The AR dollar amount is the total Gross Charges entered and/or submitted
to an insurance payer or patient but have not yet been collected. The AR
balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual
or write-off adjustments. Claims become more difficult and costlier to
collect the older they become.


    1.3 Aging of Accounts// <#aging-of-accounts>

An “account” is a billable episode of care. It begins to “age” once it
is billed to a TPP or patient. The aging of accounts is maintained in
30-day increments (0 - 30, 31 - 60, 61 - 90, and so forth.) Facilities
monitor the number of accounts outstanding and the total dollar value in
each increment (sometimes called “bins” or “buckets.”) The older the
account or the longer the account remains unpaid, the less likely the
facility will receive reimbursement for the encounter.

Most claims are originally billed to insurance, and until the insurance
makes a payment, the responsibility for the payment continues to be with
the insurance carrier. After the insurance carrier makes or denies a
payment (and there is no just cause for an appeal), the responsibility
for the balance of the account will switch to either the physician (to
be written off) or to the patient (to be sent an invoice.)

Aging categorizes AR according to the length of time charges have been
outstanding as well as the responsible parties. These time periods are
commonly 0 - 30 days, 31 - 60 days, 61 - 90 days, 91 - 120 days, and
121+ days. Aging is usually represented as a dollar amount and a percentage.

Aging can (and should) be broken down by /many/ metrics, such as
Provider, Patient, Insurance Types (Commercial, Primary, Secondary,
Worker’s Compensation, Managed Care), Facility, Diagnosis/Procedure
code, Specialty, etc.


    1.4 Days in Accounts Receivable// <#days-in-accounts-receivable>

*Days in Accounts Receivable* (also known as *DAR* or *Days in AR*) is a
common financial metric belonging to a group of ratios called /
efficiency ratios/. It measures the average amount of time it takes for
a business to collect money owed from the responsible party for services
rendered and billed.

As its name implies, the unit of measurement employed by this particular
metric is days, or rather the /average number of days/ from the moment a
physician provides a service until the patient or guarantor pays for
that service. This number can tell you much about the financial health
of the business.


    1.5 What is Days in AR?// <#what-is-days-in-ar>

At its simplest, *Days in AR* is a mathematical formula that calculates
the average amount of time it takes claims in your Accounts Receivable
to pay. Put another way, it is the average number of days that the
average invoice will remain outstanding before payment is made.
Regularly calculating and monitoring your accounts receivable days gives
you insight into how effective your business is at collecting payment on
outstanding invoices.

Good management of AR is also imperative to maintaining a good cash flow
for the business. A poor AR process can result in loss of money to the
business and, thus, financial strain on its owners. If all of these
tasks are being done properly, the DAR number should be low. A high DAR
number tells you that there is a problem in your revenue cycle.


    1.6 What Does the Number Mean?// <#what-does-the-number-mean>

So now you know that a low *DAR* number is good and a high number is
bad. How low is good though? How high is bad? Is a *DAR* of zero the
best? For instance, let’s say that a practice has a *DAR* of /95 days/.
This means that, on average, it takes the practice 95 days to collect
it’s outstanding balances. That does not sound particularly good. Maybe
it’s normal for that particular practice? Is a *DAR* of 95 good? Is it
bad? How bad or good is it?


      1.6.1 The Simple Answer// <#the-simple-answer>

Spend just a few minutes researching KPIs online and you will find as
many different suggestions and “best practices” think-pieces as there
are minutes in the day. Many practices look to more reputable
organizations such as MGMA^2 for industry-specific KPI^3 standards or
thresholds. The table below is representative of a common scale for Days
in AR you will come across when searching for benchmarking standards:


Days in Accounts Receivable
Performance
35 Days or Less
Great/Good
35 - 50 Days
Average
50 Days or More
Poor


We’ll explore these and other “rules of thumb” later, but the point of
my highlighting these “easy” answers is that they are, in fact,
excellent /general/ answers. However, each medical practice is a unique
animal, made up of a complex web of distinct attributes. Benchmarking
standards, however well-meaning they intend to be, apply to the average
of /all/ medical practices surveyed by the organization that publishes them.


      1.6.2 The Complex Answer// <#the-complex-answer>

Let’s go back to the *DAR* of /95 days/ and what it means for the
practice from the example. The /immediate/ insight is that it takes, on
average, 95 days for this practice to collect it’s unpaid balances.
The /deeper/ insight is that at least three months of working capital is
required to maintain the practice’s cash flow needs.

95 days is roughly equal to *three months*, thus, there’s three months
of unpaid work sitting in Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the
practice is going to meet its financial obligations (i.e., payroll,
rent, etc.), it’s going to need three months of cash reserves available,
or it will have to borrow these amounts, which will in turn have
additional repercussions.

The /“ideal”/ average Days in AR depends entirely upon the medical
practice, its customers (patients), and its customers’ payers, whether
they be third-party payers or the patient themselves. It also depends on
the services it supplies and the providers performing those services.
Finally, it will depend on the financial situation of the practice and
its stakeholders.

A practice’s DAR number can have different meanings across different
types of practices as well. Having a very high DAR number can be
indicative of a too-lenient policy with late-paying customers, or it
could simply be standard for your specialty. On the other hand, having a
very low DAR number could indicate a great working relationship with
your patients, or that you have a hard-line approach to your payment
policy that is alienating longtime patients and potentially cutting off
new business.


      1.6.3 A Starting Point for Further Analysis// <#a-starting-point-
      for-further-analysis>

Imagine this scenario: A tornado has hit your neighborhood while you are
away and you are worried about your house. The only way to know the true
state of your house is to go there and look around.

Judging the financial health of your medical practice by comparing it’s
performance to industry-standard benchmarks is akin to trusting a
stranger to tell you that your house is fine…while standing on the moon.

/“See? It’s that dot right there, everything’s fine.”/

The purpose of a good KPI (or group of KPIs) is to reduce the amount of
time and cognitive load it requires to understand a large, complex set
of data that is constantly being added to. The problem that many people
run into is a lack of understanding of the basic foundations of these
metrics and their fundamental inter-connectivity. End-users of the KPIs
cannot then use them to properly anticipate and prevent the problems
that they’re meant to highlight.

My proposal is a very simple one: familiarize yourself with the moving
parts of the *DAR* metric and you will know how well it is running and
what to do when it breaks down. You will be much better informed about
not only Days in AR, but most every other significant KPI, as Days in AR
connects to each of them in some way, however great or small.


    1.7 The Essence of the Calculation// <#the-essence-of-the-calculation>

The core idea of the calculation to determine *DAR* is to go through
each individual claim, count the days from the *Date of Service* to the
*Date of (full) Payment*, add all of those up, and divide by the total
number of claims. This is an extremely laborious process, so other
formulas have taken it’s place. The most commonly used is as follows:


  *

    Divide the *total Gross Charges* by the *Number of Days* in the
    period that you are measuring. This is the *Average Daily Charge*
    for that period.

  *

    Divide the *Ending AR Balance* for the same period by the *Average
    Daily Charge*. This is the average *Days in AR* for that period.


      1.7.1 Gross Charges as Opposed to Net Charges?// <#gross-charges-
      as-opposed-to-net-charges>

This is a great question and one that we’ll explore in more detail when
we discuss the Revenue Cycle workflow. The short answer is that Net
Charges excludes such things as contractual adjustments, and so it’s
missing important information. Within the space of two numbers, AR
Balance and Gross Charges, you can tell the story of an organization’s
financial history. This idea of representing comes from the world of
accounting and I find it brilliant in it’s simplicity.

To account is to bear witness. As the financial historian of a business
entity, the accountant must be able to explain in the simplest terms
possible, the financial events, past and present. As such, there is a
restriction involved, called a /monetary denominator/.

Even if no reimbursement is involved, an event is described in terms of
amounts of currency, rather than exhaustively describing the minutiae of
each paper clip purchase. This number can be investigated extensively if
the stakeholders see fit. And why wouldn’t they? It contains the
entirety of the company’s financial history.

In much the same spirit, the Gross Charge figure contains the total
account of work done while the Ending AR Balance is the exhaustive
archive of compensation and recompense on behalf of that work.


    1.8 Advantages & Disadvantages// <#advantages-disadvantages>

A few more words on what the DAR metric is and is not. Again, it would
not be appropriate to compare the DAR of medical practices with
different specialties. For example, a cardiology group’s DAR would not
compare to a plastic surgery practice’s DAR because the methods of
reimbursement for these two entities are entirely different. Not only
does the DAR metric depend on medical specialty, but also patient
demographics, payer mix, and procedure sample.

Another disadvantage is that it is sensitive to the provider because it
counts the lag time of unsubmitted claims for services already
delivered. However, this lag time roughly averages across all payers,
making DAR an effective comparison between payers for an individual
provider, but invalidating it across multiple providers. One obvious
advantage of the DAR metric is its independence of charges. The average
feature of this metric eliminates sensitivity to a specific day or CPT,
but it also hides the behavior shape of the AR curve.

To make up for these weaknesses, there are adjusted formulas as well as
other metrics (such as *PARBX*^4 ) that we’ll use to fill in these gaps.

Deferred Revenues AR (and, therefore DAR as well) may be artificially
inflated by the inclusion of items such as deferred revenues. Deferred
revenues represent amounts that customers, such as health maintenance
organizations, have prepaid for care. Until the organization provides
patient care, it shows the amount as a liability. Once it provides care,
it eliminates the liability from the balance sheet and records revenue.
Because the organization never really intends to repay these advances
(it intends to provide care), it is not as critical if these amounts
remain on the balance sheet for a number of days.

One final caution with respect to days in AR: many health care
organizations are dominated by one or two payers, such as Medicare or
Medicaid. Long term care facilities, for example, may have as much as
90% of their revenue come from a state Medicaid program. Programs like
Medicaid have been known to skip payments to providers if the annual
budget for their state is not passed on a timely basis. The providers
typically have no recourse, and the state ultimately catches up. At the
time of the skipped payment, however, the days in AR rises dramatically
(i.e., the organization is carrying twice the normal receivables). Once
again, this points to the fact that all ratios need to be taken with a
grain of salt, and the analyst must look at the context within which the
specific numerical value exists. It also shows the important of ratios,
such as days of cash on hand. Can the organization sustain a period
without cash collections?
