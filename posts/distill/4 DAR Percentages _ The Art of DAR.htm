  4 DAR Percentages// <#dar-percentages>


    Objectives// <#objectives-4>

In this section, we will discuss:

 1.

    The three numbers that you will need to calculate *Days in AR*.

 2.

    What those three numbers mean and where to find them.

 3.

    The steps in the calculation of *Days in AR*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    4.1 Overview of Percentages// <#overview-of-percentages>

Just like fractions and decimals, percentages are a way to describe
parts of a whole. When you are using percentages, the whole is
considered to be made up of a hundred equal parts. It’s easy to work out
the percentage when there are 100 individual parts making up the whole,
but what if there are more or less? The answer is that you convert the
parts of the whole into a percentage. For example, if there are 200
parts, each percentage (1%) is two parts, and every part would be half a
percent (0.5%).

The general rule for finding a given percentage of a given whole is to
work out the value of 1%, then multiply it by the percentage you need to
find.


      4.1.1 Percentages as Decimals and Fractions// <#percentages-as-
      decimals-and-fractions>

One percent is one hundredth of a whole. It can therefore be written as
both a decimal and a fraction. To write a percentage as a decimal,
simply divide it by 100. For example, 50% becomes 0.5, 20% becomes 0.2,
1% becomes 0.01 and so on.

We can calculate percentages using this knowledge. 50% is the same as a
half, so 50% of 10 is 5, because five is half of 10 (10 ÷ 2). The
decimal of 50% is 0.5. So another way of finding 50% of 10 is to say 10
× 0.5, or 10 halves.

20% of 50 is the same as saying 50 × 0.2, which equals 10.

17.5% of 380 = 380 × 0.175, which equals 66.5.

The conversion from decimal to percentage is simply the reverse
calculation: multiply your decimal by 100.

0.5 = 50% 0.875 = 87.5%

To write a percentage as a fraction, put the percentage value over a
denominator of 100, and divide it down into its lowest possible form.

50% = 50/100 = 5/10 = 1/2 20% = 20/100 = 2/10 = 1/5 30% = 30/100 = 3/10


      4.1.2 Percentages of a Whole// <#percentages-of-a-whole>

So far we have looked at the basics of percentages, and how to add or
subtract a percentage from a whole.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to work out the percentages of a whole
when you are given the numbers concerned.

For example, let’s suppose that an organisation employs 9 managers, 12
administrators, 5 accountants, 3 human resource professionals, 7
cleaners and 4 catering staff. What percentage of each type of staff
does it employ?

Start by working out the whole.

In this case, you do not know the ‘whole’, or the total number of staff
in the organisation. The first step is therefore to add together the
different types of staff.

9 managers + 12 administrators + 5 accountants + 3 HR professionals + 7
cleaners + 4 catering staff = 40 members of staff.

Work out the proportion (or fraction) of staff in each category.

We know the number of staff in each category, but we need to convert
that to a fraction of the whole, expressed as a decimal. The calculation
we need to do is:

Staff in Category ÷ Whole (See our division page for help with division
sums or use a calculator)

We can use managers as an example:

9 managers ÷ 40 = 0.225

Convert the fraction of the whole into a percentage

0.225 is the fraction of staff that are managers, expressed as a
decimal. To convert this number to a percentage, we need to multiply it
by 100. Multiplying by 100 is the same as dividing by a hundred except
you move the numbers the other way on the place values scale. So 0.225
becomes 22.5.

In other words, 22.5% of the organisation’s employees are managers.

We then do the same two calculations for each other category.

12 administrators ÷ 40 = 0.3. 0.3 × 100 = 30%. 5 accountants ÷ 40 =
0.125. 0.125 × 100 = 12.5%. 3 HR professionals ÷ 40 = 0.075. 0.075 × 100
= 7.5%. 7 cleaners ÷ 40 = 0.175. 0.175 × 100 = 17.5%. 4 catering staff ÷
40 = 0.1. 0.1 × 100 = 10%.


    4.2 Step-by-Step Example// <#step-by-step-example-1>

In this section, I’ll demonstrate the calculation for the optimal
proportions (as percentages) of |GCt| and |EARB| needed for xx |DAR|. We’ll use the data in the table below. Our *Days in AR* target
(|DARt|) is 35 days:

      4.2.1 Calculate the Actual Percentages// <#calculate-the-actual-
      percentages>

First, we need to calculate the percentage of GCt and that of EARB. To
calculate a percentage of two numbers, we first need to add the two
numbers together to create the whole that we’ll be extracting the
individual parts from.


Add GCt and EARB together to get the *whole*.

|1 + 1.5|

//

|## [1] 2.5|


To find what percentage GCt and EARB are of this whole we will divide
each by the whole and then multiply by 100:


Divide GCt and EARB by the whole, then multiply by 100.

|(1 / 2.5) * 100|

//

|## [1] 40|

|(1.5 / 2.5) * 100|

//

|## [1] 60|


So GCt is 40% and EARB is 60% of the whole of them added together. These
are the “Actual” percentages. Let’s update our table:


NDiP
GCt

      4.2.2 Calculate the Ideal Percentages// <#calculate-the-ideal-
      percentages>

Now we need to calculate the “Ideal” percentages of GCt and EARB needed
for a DARt of 35 days. Again, we need to add two numbers together to
create the whole that we’ll be taking the parts from.

This time we will create our whole(s) by adding one to the Ideal Ratio
for each of the NDiPs:

|# NDiP is 28
1 + 1.25|

//

|## [1] 2.25|

|# NDiP is 30
1 + 1.166666667|

//

|## [1] 2.166667|

|# NDiP is 31
1 + 1.129032258|

//

|## [1] 2.129032|

To get our Ideal percentages, we’ll divide 1 and the Ideal Ratio
(remember, those were our original parts) for each NDiP by this whole
and multiply by 100:

|# NDiP is 28
(1 / 2.25) * 100|

//

|## [1] 44.44444|

|(1.25 / 2.25) * 100|

//

|## [1] 55.55556|

|# NDiP is 30
(1 / 2.166666667) * 100|

//

|## [1] 46.15385|

|(1.166666667 / 2.166666667) * 100|

//

|## [1] 53.84615|

|# NDiP is 31
(1 / 2.129032258) * 100|

//

|## [1] 46.9697|

|(1.129032258 / 2.129032258) * 100|

|## [1] 53.0303|

      4.2.3 Calculate the Ideal Dollar Amounts// <#calculate-the-ideal-
      dollar-amounts>

Finally, we’ll take the whole of our /actual/ amounts (2.5) and multiply
it by both Ideal Percentages (in decimal form) to find our Ideal Dollar
Amounts:

|# NDiP is 28
2.5 * 0.444444444444444|

//

|## [1] 1.111111|

As you can see, these percentages are independent of the |GCt| and |
EARB| dollar amounts. And, from looking through the data to just where
the DAR crosses from passing to failing, we can see that, for an |NDiP|
of /31/, the optimal percentage for |GCt| is approximately *44.01%*,
while |EARB|’s optimal percentage is *55.99%*.

The optimal /difference/ between the two amounts is *11.99%*. If |GCt|
*falls below* 44.01%, the |DAR| is failing. If |EARB| *rises above*
55.99%, the |DAR| is failing. If the /difference/ between the two *rises
above* 11.99%, the |DAR| is failing.

*The DAR Fails IF:*

  *

    |GCt| *falls below* 44.01%

  *

    |EARB| *rises above* 55.99%

  *

    the /Difference/ between |GCt| and |EARB| *rises above* 11.99%

      4.5.3 31-Day NDiP// <#day-ndip-2>

The following is a table of sample data wherein each row contains a *31-
day* month’s financial activity, sorted by |DAR| in descending order. In
addition to the /DAR Ratio/ measurements, there are several new figures
included.

Under the /Percentages/ spanner, the first two figures represent the
individual proportions of *Gross Charges* and *Ending AR* to the whole
of those two figures added together. The /Difference/ percentage is that
of the difference between the Gross Charges and Ending AR in relation to
the whole figure as well.
