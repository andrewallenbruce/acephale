    6.1 PARBxx// <#parbx>

PARBxx, or the *Percentage of Accounts Receivable Beyond* xx Days, resolves the sensitivity issues of the Days in AR metric. It
offers a simple billing process metric that’s not dependent on the charge.

Its graphic representation has a skewed bell shape. Its steepness
represents billing process quality; a steep curve and thin tail mean a
healthy billing process, while a flat bell and fat tail also mean
billing problems.

According to the MGMA survey, 25%-35% of the average family practice’s
accounts receivables were more than 120 days old in 1997. This number
has improved down to 17.7% in 2004.

    The probability of getting a claim paid shrinks by approximately 1%
    per day.

The most important version of PARBX is the Percentage of AR Beyond 120
Days. It is one of the best indicators of your billing performance. This
is the percentage of your AR that you have not been paid for more than
120 days since you submitted the claims. Since the probability of
getting a claim paid shrinks by about 1% per day, the claims waiting
longer than 120 days are unlikely to be paid at all.

To calculate PARBX 120, simply divide the AR amount that is 121+ days
old by the overall AR amount. Suppose your overall AR is $150,000 and
PARBX 120 is $30,000. PARBX 120 is 30,000 / 150,000 = 20%. That means
that you’re treating every fifth patient for free.


    6.2 Billing Performance Index// <#billing-performance-index>

The Billing Performance Index (BPI) is a benchmarking technique inspired
by prominent Wall Street firms that have little tolerance for walking
away from money. When evaluating trader performance, Wall Street uses
the context of the entire market to give a more accurate picture. The
profit or loss for a given company may or may not mean success or
failure of that company’s market-traded securities, depending on the
direction and movement of the markets in which those instruments trade.
It’s all about context because in market trading, markets are every bit
as influential as profits on stock price in the short term. Most large
sell-side brokerage firms on Wall Street compute various indices on a
daily basis. By comparing the performance of a trader’s investment
portfolio with that of an entire index, one can immediately determine if
the trader has been successful or is failing relative to the entire
market; this can be more meaningful than absolute numbers for a given
security or portfolio.

The most popular indexing technique on Wall Street is rule-based; pre-
defined rules select the instruments to include in an index, depending
on specific parameter values of those instruments at the time of
computation. The advantage of rule-driven indexing is that participation
is dynamically determined at a point in time, reflecting the dynamic
nature of the entire market. Today’s top 10 list of index performers may
not include the same names next week.

A financial instrument’s specific performance is recomputed every time
the index itself is computed, reflecting the dynamic nature of
performance relative to the market itself. If an instrument performs
well in a strong market, the index takes this into account, since most
participants are also doing well. The same is true on the downside - if
a financial instrument performs poorly in a down market, the index
clarifies that this may not be because of some inherent weakness in the
company itself; rather, performance is reflected in the context of the
entire market environment in which that security trades.

An indexing approach can help to redefine the payer-provider standoff in
healthcare. A payer might be considered for inclusion in an index if
total processed volume in the past month exceeded a certain amount (say,
$100 million). Participation in the index would be driven by multiple
criteria, starting with a necessary minimum threshold of submitted
claims, and including the all-important billing performance index. Payer
participation in the index is defined dynamically at the time of
computation, not by a static listing of specific payers. Therefore, any
specific payer may or may not be included in the index for a given
month, depending on that payer’s performance.

For example, let’s say in June 20xx, the Billing Performance Index (BPI)
stood at 14.8, almost 3% below the national average of 17.7% (a BPI of
14.8 mean that the average of the 10 top-performing payers that work
with ABC Billing Company clients have 14.8% of Accounts Receivable
beyond 120 days).

BPI is a key billing performance characteristic because it’s an
indicator of claims that are never paid. Obviously, the lower the index,
the better the billing performance. But this statistic is meaningful
only when considered in the context of the relative performance of other
payers. Let’s look at a comparative example. The December 20xx BPI
improved 0.8% from its November mark, reaching 18.8 - but this was still
6.2% worse than the national average of 17.7. The December index, just
like the October and November indices, maintained both its membership
(the same top-performing payers) and the two lead positions: Medicare
Illinois and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois.

RANK 	CHANGE 	PAYER 	Nov BPI 	Dec BPI
1 	NONE 	Medicare Illinois 	5.8 	6.8
2 	NONE 	BCBS Illinois 	7.9 	8.1
3 	▲ from 4 	Cigna 	15.7 	10.7
4 	▲ from 4 	Horizon BCBS New Jersey 	20.7 	13.9
5 	▲ from 4 	Aetna 	20.0 	14.8
6 	▼ from 5 	Medicare New Jersey 	19.4 	18.8
7 	▼ from 5 	UnitedHealthcare 	15.0 	21.2
8 	▲ from 4 	GEICO 	36.2 	35.2
9 	▲ from 4 	BCBS Georgia 	39.9 	43.3
10 	▼ from 5 	BCBS Pennsylvania 	30.5 	43.4
—- 	——– 	*Average of Top 10 Payers* 	*19.6* 	*18.8*

In summary, simply comparing a payer’s performance metric with a
national benchmark determines if that payer performs well. This approach
to benchmarking also allows ranking within an entire set of payers; you
can sort them according to the same performance metric. And benchmarking
allows you to identify elite payers - those that perform best compared
with every payer in the country, as shown by the index-driven ranking.
Finally, since the billing index represents the performance of an entire
set of participants, the number of times a given payer has been selected
determines its historic performance.


      6.2.1 Billing Quality// <#billing-quality>

/Comparative Analysis Using Performance Index/

It’s good to have choices. And if you’re a provider staring at a list of
accounts receivable that are creeping up on 120 days, those choices
become meaningful. The way to choose is by using the power of indexing
to compare payment performance among insurance companies on a level
playing field that ranks payers according to selected criteria. The same
indexing concepts that quantify and rank payers can also be used to rank
medical billing services. There are two limitations to consider:

 1.

    *Scope*: Since each medical billing service submits claims only to a
    defined subset of payers - those that insure the patients of the
    providers served by that billing service - the scope of an
    individual billing service index is limited by those claims. For
    example, if a service works with only three payers, its index has an
    entirely different scope than that of a service that works with 12
    payers; one bad apple in a field of three can skew the whole picture.

 2.

    *Perspective*: Scope isn’t the only variable in understanding
    indexing. The perspective of the billing service is also important.
    Since each of the providers served by a biller sees only a subset of
    the total patient population insured by a given payer, the
    provider’s perspective is limited by the number of patients that the
    provider sees. Data obtained from 19 patients is more easily skewed
    by aberrations than data from a patient base of 3,000.

    These indexing limitations, scope, and perspective drive the
    distinction between “ideal” and “partial” payer performance indices.


      6.2.2 Partial vs. Ideal BPI// <#partial-vs.-ideal-bpi>

An “*ideal*” medical billing performance index is computed from
comprehensive statistics across all providers nationally, irrespective
of the billing service that helped process the claims.

A “*partial*” payer’s performance index is computed from statistics
across all providers who are served by a specific billing service or
individual provider.

So, using the “ideal” index, healthcare providers can see which payers
perform best across the board, and by using a “partial” index, providers
can ascertain how a payer is doing with a specific billing service’s claims.

In other words, the rule of thumb is to know your index to understand
your payer. Obviously, index quality is directly proportional to scope
and perspective: the wider the scope and the broader the perspective of
the billing service associated with an index, the better the resulting
data. While the “partial” performance index, computed on the basis of a
specific biller’s observations, only approximates the “ideal” index,
it’s the only realistic payer performance index available today.

Since medical billing services use different billing processes and
technologies, such partial indices rank the same payers differently -
and, in fact, they may contain different payer members at different
points during the same month. In this sense, the “partial” medical
billing index becomes a characteristic of the billing service, instead
of the payer; this allows providers to select the best medical billing
service available based on this data, and it challenges billers across
the nation to continuously improve their service quality.


      6.2.3 Compute Medical Billing Index// <#compute-medical-billing-
      index>

 1. Compute the percentage of your AR that has aged beyond 120 days for
    each individual payer
 2. Weight-average them across all your payers. This emphasizes the
    payers to whom you submit the most claims versus those lesser-used
    insurers
 3. Compare your payer index results with the monthly Billing
    Performance Index
 4. If your index is higher, then your office billing process might
    benefit from improvements


      6.2.4 Annual BPI Summary// <#annual-bpi-summary>

The Billing Performance Index (BPI) reflects payer performance stability
over time based on CPT codes. The monthly BPI lists the 10 best-paying
insurance companies in that month, selected according to multiple
criteria - e.g., minimal processed claim volume. In contrast, the annual
BPI simply counts the frequency of the payer’s participation in the
monthly BPI for that year.

A low percentage of accounts receivable beyond 120 days is critical to
being included in the billing index. However, the frequency of inclusion
in the index is a more robust performance metric, because it measures
billing performance consistency over a longer time period. The following
example table lists the insurance companies that made the BPI listing
for 20xx, along with their average, low, and high billing index for the
year.

*Rank* 	*Months Included* 	*Payer* 	*BPI Avg* 	*BPI Low* 	*BPI High*
