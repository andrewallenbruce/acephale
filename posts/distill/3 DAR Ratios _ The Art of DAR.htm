    3.1 Overview of Ratio Types// <#overview-of-ratio-types>

A *ratio* is a mathematical parameter used to express the relationship
of one quantity to another. To calculate a ratio, one quantity is
divided by another. The quotient can be greater than 1 or less than 1.
For example, if seven men and five women were in a group, the ratio of
men to women would be 7575. This may also be written as *7:5* and verbalized as “7 to 5.”

The numbers 7 and 5 have no common factors, so this ratio cannot be
simplified any further. However, if the group consisted of 6 men and 10
women, the ratio would be *6:10*. Because the numbers in this ratio have
a common factor of 2, the ratio can be simplified by dividing each
number by 2, which simplifies the ratio to *3:5*.

One more thing of note: since a ratio can be expressed as a fraction,
the quotient of the fraction is another viable way of displaying a ratio:


7:5=75=1.43:5=35=0.6 (3.1)
7:5=75=1.43:5=35=0.6(3.1) 


A *proportion* is a /type/ of ratio in which xx is a portion of the whole (x+y)(x+y). In a proportion, the numerator is always included in the
denominator. For example, if two women out of a group of 10 over the age
of 50 have had breast cancer, where x=2x=2 (women who have had breast cancer) and y=8y=8 (women who have not had breast cancer), the calculation would be 2
divided by 10. The proportion of women who have had breast cancer is 0.20.2 or 20%20%.


x(x+y)=2(2+8)2(2+8)=210210=0.20.2×100=20%(3.2)
(3.2)x(x+y)=2(2+8)2(2+8)=210210=0.20.2×100=20%


A *rate*^6 is another /type/ of ratio in which there is a distinct
relationship between the numerator and denominator and the denominator
often implies a large base population. A measure of time is often an
intrinsic part of the denominator. The basic rule of thumb for
calculating a rate is to indicate the number of times something /
actually/ happened in relation to the number of times it /possibly could
have/ happened (*actual*/*potential*).

For example, let’s say you have been eating out often in the past few
weeks. To calculate the rate of meals you have eaten out in one week,
divide the number of meals that you ate out (for example, 13) by the
number of meals you could have eaten out (21). The calculation is:


PartBase=Rate1321=0.6190476190476190.6191×100=61.9%(3.3)
(3.3)PartBase=Rate1321=0.6190476190476190.6191×100=61.9%


      3.1.1 A Note on Percentages// <#a-note-on-percentages>

As you can see above, the solutions to the proportions and rates can be
expressed as a percentage, while the ratio cannot. There is a very good
reason for this, though not one that immediately presents itself. Let’s
look at the definitions again:


*Ratio* 	A mathematical parameter used to express the relationship of
one quantity to another, where one quantity is divided by another.
*Proportion* 	A type of ratio in which the numerator (xx) is a portion of the whole (x+yx+y). In a proportion, /the numerator is always included in the
denominator./
*Rate* 	A type of ratio in which there is a distinct relationship
between the numerator and denominator and the denominator often implies
a large base population.
*Percentage* 	A unit of /proportion/ expressed as a fraction of 100. A
percentage is a /dimensionless/ number that has no unit of measurement.


A proportion and a rate can be represented as a percentage because their
numerators are inherently part of their denominators. This is not so for
a ratio as it’s only comparing one number to another, even though the
two numbers might be of the same group.

Something about each quantity separates it from the other (in this case,
gender) and, as such, we want to know how many with attribute A there
are compared to how many with attribute B there are. With anything so
simple, it can be easy to overthink and misunderstand the concept.

Look at the ratio example again. There are seven men and five women in a
group. We want to know how many men there are and how many women there
are. Nothing more, nothing less. Thus, the ratio of men to women in this
group is *7 to 5*.

To compare, if we wanted to know the /proportions/ of men and women in
this group, we would have to involve a numerical representation of the
group as a whole. There are *seven men* and *five women* in the group.
This *group*, then, contains a total of *twelve people*. We can now
calculate these proportions, representing the results as percentages:


x(x+y)=7(7+5)=712712=0.5833×100=58.33% meny(x+y)=5(7+5)=512512=0.4167×100=41.67% women(3.4)
(3.4)x(x+y)=7(7+5)=712712=0.5833×100=58.33% meny(x+y)=5(7+5)=512512=0.4167×100=41.67% women


Financial ratios play an important role in analyzing the financial
health and performance of a business. In terms of those most useful to a
medical practice or healthcare organization, several are excellent
measures of the performance of Accounts Receivable.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


    3.2 The “1.5x” Rule// <#the-1.5x-rule>

Let’s test out one of the many AR management “best practices” that I
have come across time and again:

    /your monthly *Ending Accounts Receivable Balance* should _never_ be
    more than/ *1.5 times* /your *total Gross Monthly Charges*./


In other words, if your |GCt| is *$1.00* at the end of the month, then
your |EARB| can be no more than *$1.50* or you are in trouble. Are you
though? Assuming our organization’s target |DAR| is *35 days*, I am
going to calculate the |DAR| for each of the three monthly |NDiP|s to
find out:

NDiP
GCt
EARB
DAR
DARt

$1.00
$1.50

$1.00
$1.50
45

Fail
31
$1.00
$1.50
46.5
35
Fail


Confirmed, you are in BIG trouble. Because you need to find a better
measure of monthly AR performance.

But why is this *1.5x* rule so bad? Two very big reasons: it doesn’t
consider 1) a |DAR| benchmark of any kind or 2) the number of days in
the period that it is measuring.


      3.2.1 Bad Advice, Great Example// <#bad-advice-great-example>

Even though the *1.5x* rule is comically bad advice, it is a /great/
example of a ratio and a prime opportunity to showcase many of the
things calculating a ratio can do. Let me explain.

If, according to this rule, your |EARB| should never be more than 1.5
times your monthly |GCt|, then the /ideal/ ratio of |EARB| to |GCt| is
*1.5* to *1*. Since you can represent this as a fraction and divide,
the /ideal/ ratio is also *1.5* (1.5÷1=1.51.5÷1=1.5).

Let’s test out this /ideal/ to show why is it not what it says it is.
Suppose that your |EARB| is *$203,460.50* and your |GCt| is
*$131,440.30*. Therefore, your /actual/ ratio is *203,460.50* to
*131,440.30*. Represent this as a fraction and divide:


203,460.50131,440.30=1.548(3.5)
(3.5)203,460.50131,440.30=1.548


Your /actual/ ratio of |EARB| to |GCt| is *1.548*. In other words, your
|EARB| is *1.548 times* your |GCt|, breaking the 1.5x rule. We can check
this by multiplying the |GCt| by 1.5 and seeing whether or not the
result is less than our |EARB| (spoiler: it is):


131440.30×1.5=197,160.45203,460.50>197,160.45(3.6)
131440.30×1.5=197,160.45(3.6)203,460.50>197,160.45


Calculating and comparing this /‘actual’/ ratio and it’s /‘ideal’/
counterpart is the beginning of a set of tools that I’ve come to call
the |DAR| Ratio.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


    3.3 The DAR Ratios// <#the-dar-ratios>

In Chapter 3, we established three formulas showing the
interrelationship between the |DAR| variables:


GCtNDiP=EARBDARDARNDiP=EARBGCtGCtEARB=NDiPDAR(3.7)
GCtNDiP=EARBDARDARNDiP=EARBGCt(3.7)GCtEARB=NDiPDAR


The second equation is the foundation of this so-called /DAR Ratio/. The
left side of the equation represents the /Ideal/ Ratio for xx |DAR|, consisting of the ratio of your organization’s desired DAR
target (or |DARt|) to the Number of Days in the Period (|NDiP|). The
right side is your /Actual/ Ratio, which is the ratio of your |EARB| to
your |GCt|. Let’s set this up in equation form:

Actual Ratio=EARBGCtIdeal Ratio=DARtNDiP(3.8)
Actual Ratio=EARBGCt(3.8)Ideal Ratio=DARtNDiP


I will use the table of figures from our earlier /1.5x/ example to
demonstrate a good use case for the |DAR| ratios:

NDiP

Our desired DAR target (|DARt|) was 35 days, our |EARB| was $1.50, and
our |GCt| was $1.00. Let’s divide:

Actual Ratio=EARBGCt1.50=1.501.00Ideal Ratio=DARtNDiP1.25=35281.166667=35301.12903226=3531(3.8)
(3.8)Actual Ratio=EARBGCt1.50=1.501.00Ideal
Ratio=DARtNDiP1.25=35281.166667=35301.12903226=3531


Now our table looks like this:

We now know that if our |DAR| target is /35 days/ and we are in a month
with /28/, /30/ or /31/ days, then our |EARB| needs to be,
respectively, /1.25/, /1.17/, or /1.13/ times our |GCt|. This is why it
is called the /Ideal Ratio/.

In the same way that we used the formula for *EARB Required for* xx DAR in Chapter 3, we can use the /Ideal Ratio/ to get the same result.

We simply take the |GCt| amounts in our table above and multiply them by
the /Ideal Ratio/. This will give us the |EARB| amounts required for a |
DAR| of 35 days:


GCt×Ideal Ratio=EARB Required1.00×1.25=1.251.00×1.17=1.171.00×1.13=1.13(3.9)
(3.9)GCt×Ideal Ratio=EARB Required1.00×1.25=1.251.00×1.17=1.171.00×1.13=1.13


To make sure these |EARB| amounts are correct, we will plug them into
our DAR formula:


EARBGCt÷NDiP=DAR1.251.00÷28=351.171.00÷30=351.131.00÷31=35(3.10)
(3.10)EARBGCt÷NDiP=DAR1.251.00÷28=351.171.00÷30=351.131.00÷31=35


And update our table:

      3.3.1 Ratio Variables Do Not Move Together as One// <#ratio-
      variables-do-not-move-together-as-one>


Remember that the “Actual” Ratio we’re calculating here is |EARB|
divided by |GCt|, and not |GCt| divided by |EARB|. This is important
because it makes |EARB| dependent on |GCt|.

In other words, |GCt| will never change because of a change in |EARB|,
which is true in the real world.

|EARB| changes on a /daily/ basis because of |GCt|. This is because
every Gross Charge is added to the AR Balance whether that charge is
paid immediately (and is subtracted from the AR Balance) or 90 days later.

Another important reason to mention this is that, just as you can use
the formulas for |EARB| Required for xx |DARt| and |GCt| Required for xx |DARt|, you can also calculate both of these using the |DAR| Ratios.
However, calculating one will not tell you the other. They are
completely independent of each other.


  *

    Calculating the |EARB| required will tell you *ONLY* the |EARB|
    required for that |GCt|.

  *

    Calculating the |GCt| required will tell you *ONLY* the |GCt|
    required for that |EARB|.


Making these amounts work in harmony, given xx |DARt|, requires a proportion and is the subject of the next chapter,
*the DAR Percentages*.

The following tables and graphs illustrate the relationship between |
EARB| and |GCt|, given that one or the other is constant.

As you can see from the above graph and table, the |EARB| amount
required for a |DARt| of 35 days decays rapidly, only beginning to
stabilize around day 35 (of course.) This is in stark contrast to |GCt|:

The |GCt| amount required for a |DARt| of 35 days rises steadily in a
linear fashion over the same period of time. These results are
strikingly different to the graph you will see in Chapter 5, wherein |
GCt| and |EARB| are graphed as parts of a whole, i.e. interacting with
each other.

    3.4 Using the DAR Ratios// <#using-the-dar-ratios>

Let’s examine some sample data and apply the DAR ratios to this data.
The following table contains 12 months of financial data from a
physician practice.

The accompanying graph charts the |EARB| and |GCt| across those months.
As you will see, |DAR| failed four months in a row, from *March* to *June*.

What jumps out at you when looking through the data?


*total Gross Charges* & *Ending AR Balance* 12-Month Comparison. *DARt*
is 39.445.

*Some Quick Takeaways from the Data*

Examining the four months that failed on the graph, you can see that:

  *

    When |GCt| falls too far below |EARB|, |DAR| exceeds the 39.445 target.

  *

    When the two get close enough, |DAR| is under the target.


Looking at the data in the table, you can see that:

  *

    If the *Difference* between the Actual and Ideal Ratio is
    *positive*, |DAR| is /over/ the target set by the Ideal Ratio
    (39.445, in this case) and is /failing/.

  *

    If the *Difference* is *negative*, |DAR| is /under/ the target or /
    passing/.


    /Note: |DAR| would meet the target (39.445) if the Difference was
    zero, but this will never be the case, as the |GCt| and |EARB| will
    never be the exact same number./


Another interesting find is that if you plot each month’s *Ratio
Difference* and *Days in AR*, they line up in an exact one-to-one
relationship:

*Ratio Difference* & *Days in AR* 12-Month Comparison. *DARt* is 39.445.

    3.5 A Ratio Describes The Slope of a Line// <#a-ratio-describes-the-
    slope-of-a-line>

The /Ideal/ ratio represents the slope of a line. Actually, any ratio
represents the slope of a line.

The *slope* of a line (also called its /gradient/) is equal to the ratio
of the change in y-coordinates to the change in x-coordinates. This
slope shows the rise of a line in the plane along with the distance
covered in the x-axis.

The /Ideal/ ratio is equal to the change /needed/ in |EARB| relative to
the change in |GCt|, given a certain |DARt| and |NDiP|.

Let’s try to unpack all of that. The most common form of a linear
equation (an equation describing a line) is the *slope-intercept form*,
represented as:


y=mx+bWhere:y=y-coordinatem=slopex=x-coordinateb=y-intercept(3.11)
(3.11)y=mx+bWhere:y=y-coordinatem=slopex=x-coordinateb=y-intercept


How does this apply to *Days in AR*? First, this formula is yet another
way of calculating the |EARB| or |GCt| needed for xx |DAR|. Let’s re-label the formula:


y=mx+bWhere:y=EARBm=Ideal Ratiox=GCtb=0(3.12)
(3.12)y=mx+bWhere:y=EARBm=Ideal Ratiox=GCtb=0


What *Ending AR Balance* would you need for a target |DAR| of 35 days on
the 25th day of the Period, with a *Gross Charges total* of $80? First,
calculate your /Ideal/ ratio (35÷25=1.435÷25=1.4). Now substitute these figures into the formula:


y=mx+bWhere:y=EARBm=Ideal Ratiox=GCtb=0112=(1.4×80)+0(3.13)
(3.13)y=mx+bWhere:y=EARBm=Ideal Ratiox=GCtb=0112=(1.4×80)+0


So, if your Gross Charges total was $80, your Ending AR would need to be
$112 (or less) to meet a target DAR of 35 days on the 25th day of the
period. /Note: The Ideal ratio represents the slope of a line that
intercepts the y-axis at (0,0), so the y-intercept will always be zero./


    *Reminder*: If your /Ideal/ Ratio is 1.4, that means that your
    *Ending AR Balance* must be /equal to or less than/ 1.4 times your
    *total Gross Charges* (for an |NDiP| of 25 and a |DARt| of 35.) In
    the above example, this means that your *Ending AR* would need to be
    $112 or less.

    As the |NDiP| climbs, the /Ideal/ Ratio will dip below 1. A target |
    DAR| of 35 with an |NDiP| of 90 results in an /Ideal/ Ratio of
    approximately 0.38888. In other words, your *Ending AR* must be /
    equal to or less than/ 0.38888 times your |GCt|. For an |NDiP| of
    90, a |DARt| of 35, and a |GCt| of $80, your |EARB| would need to be
    equal to or less than $31.11.


      3.5.1 Graphing the Ideal Slope// <#graphing-the-ideal-slope>

Visualing data can be immensely helpful in understanding what’s going
on. Below is a table of data and a graph of that data.

The *diagonal dashed line* represents the Ideal ratio for a |DARt| of 35
days and an |NDiP| of 25.

|GCt| is the x-coordinate and |EARB| is the y-coordinate. What jumps out
at you from the data on the graph?


|NDiP| = 25, |DARt| = 35. y-intercept (bb) = 0, slope (mm) = 1.4.

First, you can see that if the |GCt|/|EARB| combination is below the |
DARt| (passing Days in AR), it’s point on the graph is to the *RIGHT*
and *BELOW* the dashed diagonal line.

If the |GCt|/|EARB| combination is above the |DARt| (failing Days in
AR), it’s point is to the *LEFT* and *ABOVE* the dashed diagonal line.

Moreover, you can tell just by looking at the points how close a |GCt|/|
EARB| combo is to failing or passing Days in AR.

For the row with a |GCt| of $4 and an |EARB| of $9, you can see that the
|GCt| needs to increase by just $1.00 to pass Days in AR.


      3.5.2 A More Thorough Example// <#a-more-thorough-example>

Below is a dataset of 88 rows, each one representing one 31-day month.
Each month’s GCt and EARB is plotted on the scatter plot (GCt on the x-
axis, EARB on the y-axis). The slope for a target Days in AR of 39.445
has been mapped to the dashed black line. Explore the dataset and the
interactive plot.
