  2 DAR Formulas// <#dar-formulas>


    Objectives// <#objectives-2>

In this section, we will discuss:

 1.

    The three numbers that you will need to calculate *Days in AR*.

 2.

    What those three numbers mean and where to find them.

 3.

    The steps in the calculation of *Days in AR*.

 4.

    How to create new formulas from the base *Days in AR* formula.

 5.

    What you can learn from these new formulas and why you might want to
    do so.

 6.

    The relationship between the variables involved in *Days in AR*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    2.1 The Three Numbers// <#the-three-numbers>

You need only */three/* numbers to calculate the average *Days in AR*.
They are the /Number of Days in the Period/, the /total Gross Charges/
for that period, and the /Ending AR Balance/. Technically, you will also
need the /Average Daily Charge/, but you can derive this number from two
of the three essential numbers:


      2.1.1 Number of Days in the Period// <#number-of-days-in-the-period>

This is literally the number of days within the period for which you are
measuring *Days in AR*. DAR is typically measured in monthly and
quarterly increments, so this number will usually hover around 30, 60,
90, etc. The following table contains a list of common reporting periods
and the number of days in each:


Number of Days
Reporting Periods
​28 (1)
February
​30 (4)
April, June, September, November
​31 (7)
January, March, May, July, August, October, December
​90 (1)
First Quarter
​91 (1)
Second Quarter
​92 (2)
Third Quarter, Fourth Quarter
Previous1Next


      2.1.2 Total Gross Charges// <#total-gross-charges>

Gross charges, which are the /full/ fee schedule^5 charges, are all
charges generated by the practice, regardless of actual reimbursement.
The Gross Charges figure is the total dollar amount charged during the /
Number of Days in the Period/ that you are measuring. Whether billed to
insurance on a claim or to a self-pay patient, all charges for the
period are included here.


      2.1.3 Average Daily Charge// <#average-daily-charge>

This number is the /total Gross Charges/ amount divided by the /Number
of Days in the Period/.


      2.1.4 Ending AR Balance// <#ending-ar-balance>

This is the Accounts Receivables balance ($USD) at the /close of
business (COB)/ on the final day of the /Period/ that you are measuring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    2.2 Step-by-Step Example// <#step-by-step-example>

Let’s go through an example of the *Days in AR* calculation, step-by-
step. The following table contains the *three* data points you need to
calculate *Days in AR*:

Number of Days in Period
Gross Charges
Ending AR Balance
30
$131,440.30
$203,460.50


      2.2.1 Calculate the Average Daily Charge// <#calculate-the-
      average-daily-charge>

First, we need to calculate the *Average Daily Charge*. The formula is
as follows:


Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily Charge(2.1)
(2.1)Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily Charge


Take the *Gross Charges* from the table above, divide it by the *Number
of Days in the Period* and our *Average Daily Charge* will be *$4,381.34*:


Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily Charge131,440.3030=4,381.34(2.2)
Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily
Charge(2.2)131,440.3030=4,381.34


*total Gross Charges* / *Number of Days in the Period* = *Average Daily
Charge*.

|131440.30 / 30|

//

|## [1] 4381.343|

/(Note: This is an R language <https://www.rstudio.com/> coding chunk. I
will be using these to show the outputs of calculations for the sake of
accuracy.)/


      2.2.2 Calculate the Days in AR// <#calculate-the-days-in-ar>

Now that we have the three variables required by the DAR formula, we can
calculate the *Days in AR*. The formula is as follows:


Ending AR BalanceAverage Daily Charge=Days in AR(2.3)
(2.3)Ending AR BalanceAverage Daily Charge=Days in AR


Substitute the *Ending AR Balance* and *Average Daily Charge* into the
formula and divide:

Ending AR BalanceAverage Daily Charge=Days in AR203,460.504,381.34=46.44(2.4)
Ending AR BalanceAverage Daily Charge=Days in
AR(2.4)203,460.504,381.34=46.44


*Ending AR Balance* / *Average Daily Charge* = *Days in AR*.

|203460.50 / 4381.34|

//

|## [1] 46.43796|


This gives us an average *Days in AR* of *46.44* days. Now our report
table looks like this:

Results

131,440.30
total Gross Charges
203,460.50
Average Daily Charge
4,381.34
Days in Accounts Receivable
46.44


    2.3 Visualizing Days in AR// <#visualizing-days-in-ar>

In terms of Days in AR, the figures usually involve time-series data,
i.e. month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, etc. For time-series, best
practices generally involve a line plot, tracing the Days in AR figures
from left to right (in English-speaking cultures.)

If the stakeholders that you are presenting the data to have an
established Days in AR target for their organization (for instance, it’s
39.445 in the graph below), it would help to map it across the time
series, as I’ve mapped it as the black dotted line.

Another suggestion I would make is to differentiate between those
months/quarters that were under (Passed) or over (Failed) the target
threshold.


*Days in AR* Report: /2021/ Month-to-Month. (DAR Target = 39.445)

Another way to visualize Days in AR is to chart the month-to-month
variance from the target Days in AR:

    2.4 Building on the DAR Formula// <#building-on-the-dar-formula>

Now that we have a basic understanding of the formula for *Days in AR*,
we can expand upon and rearrange it to do many other things. The
formulas we will derive from the basic DAR calculation in this chapter
will allow us to perform many, many different kinds of data analysis. To
start off, we will include the calculation for the *Average Daily
Charge* in the denominator of our basic |DAR| formula:


Days in AR=Ending AR Balancetotal Gross Charges÷Number of Days in Period(2.5)
(2.5)Days in AR=Ending AR Balancetotal Gross Charges÷Number of Days in
Period


To simplify things, I’m going to begin using mathematical variables and
acronyms for these numbers. They are as follows:

*Variable* 	*Acronym* 	*Description*
nn 	|NDiP| 	Number of Days in the Period
xx 	|GCt| 	total Gross Charges for |NDiP|
yy 	|EARB| 	Ending AR Balance
cc 	|ADC| 	Average Daily Charge for |NDiP|
zz 	|DAR| 	*Days in AR*
tt 	|DARt| 	Target *Days in AR*


The *Days in AR* formula can now be represented in several ways:

Days in AR=Ending AR BalanceGross Charges÷Number of Days in PeriodDAR=EARBGCt÷NDiPz=yx÷n(2.6)
(2.6)Days in AR=Ending AR BalanceGross Charges÷Number of Days in
PeriodDAR=EARBGCt÷NDiPz=yx÷n

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.1 EARB Required for xx DAR// <#earb-required-for-x-dar>

What if we wanted to know the exact *Ending AR Balance* we would need to
attain a certain number of *Days in AR*? First, we will need to find the
formula for |EARB|. We have our |DAR| formula converted to variables to
make it easier to visualize what is going on mathematically:


If:   DAR=EARBGCt÷NDiPWhere:   y=EARB  x=GCt  n=NDiP  z=DAR  Then:   z=yx÷n(2.7)
(2.7)If:   DAR=EARBGCt÷NDiPWhere:   y=EARB  x=GCt  n=NDiP  z=DAR  Then:   z=yx÷n

We can find the formula for |EARB| by taking the formula for |DAR| and
solving for yy:

y=zxnEARB=DAR×GCtNDiP(2.8)
(2.8)y=zxnEARB=DAR×GCtNDiP

Let’s use our table of results from the example in *Chapter 2* and say
that we would like to have achieved a |DAR| of *39.44*. What *Ending AR
Balance* would we have needed?

NDiP
GCt
ADC
DARt
30
$131,440.30
$4,381.34
39.445


Substituting the known variables from the table into our |EARB| formula
and performing the calculation gives us a new |EARB| of *$172,822.09*:

*DARt* (tt) multiplied by *GCt* (xx), then divided by *NDiP* (nn), = *EARB* (yy).

|(39.445 * 131440.30) / 30|

//

|## [1] 172822.1|


This is the *Ending AR Balance* we would need for 39.445 *Days in AR*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.2 GCt Required for xx DAR// <#gct-required-for-x-dar>

We can perform the same steps if we wanted to know the *total Gross
Charges* we would need for a certain number of *Days in AR*. We can find
the formula for |GCt| by taking the formula for |DAR| and solving for xx:

x=ynzGCt=EARB×NDiPDAR(2.9)
(2.9)x=ynzGCt=EARB×NDiPDAR

We would again like to have achieved a |DAR| of *39.445.* What *total
Gross Charges* would we have needed to achieve this result?

NDiP
EARB
ADC
DARt
30
$203,460.50
$4,381.34
39.445

If we plug our known variables into our formula for *total Gross
Charges*, we get a |GCt| of *$154,742.43*.

*EARB* (yy) multiplied by *NDiP* (nn), then divided by *DARt* (tt) , = *GCt* (xx).

|(203460.50 * 30) / 39.445|

//

|## [1] 154742.4|


The *Average Daily Charge* is determined in part by |GCt|, thus we will
need to recalculate it since |GCt| has changed. Dividing the new |GCt|
amount by the |NDiP| gives us a new |ADC| of *$5,158.08*.

*GCt* (xx) divided by *NDiP* (nn) = *ADC* (cc).

|154742.43 / 30|

//

|## [1] 5158.081|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.3 NDiP Required for xx DAR// <#ndip-required-for-x-dar>

We can perform the same steps if we wanted to know the *Number of Days*
we’d need to attain a certain number of *Days in AR*. To find the
formula for |NDiP|, we take the formula for |DAR| and solve for nn, giving us:

zxy=n(2.10)
(2.10)zxy=n

Looking back at our table, we would again like to have achieved a |DAR|
of *39.44.* What *Number of Days in the Period* would we have needed to
achieve this result?

$131,440.30

If we plug our known variables into our formula for total Gross Charges,
we get an |NDiP| of *25.48*.

*DARt* (tt) multiplied by *GCt* (xx), then divided by *EARB* (yy), = *NDiP* (nn).

|(39.445 * 131440.30) / 203460.50|

//

|## [1] 25.4824|

As the *Average Daily Charge* is determined in part by |NDiP|, this
calculation will also change it, to *$5,158.08*.

*GCt* (xx) divided by *NDiP* (nn) = *ADC* (cc).

|131440.30 / 25.4824|

//

|## [1] 5158.082|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.4 ADC Required for xx DAR// <#adc-required-for-x-dar>

This formula is going to be a bit different from the previous three.
Remember, our formula for the *Average Daily Charge* is:


Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily Charge(2.11)
(2.11)Gross ChargesNumber of Days in Period=Average Daily Charge


Let’s take our DAR formula and make the appropriate adjustments:


If:   EARBADC=DARWhere:   EARB=y  ADC=c  DAR=z  Then:   yc=z(2.12)
(2.12)If:   EARBADC=DARWhere:   EARB=y  ADC=c  DAR=z  Then:   yc=z


To find the formula for |ADC|, we take the formula for |DAR| and solve for cc, giving us:

yz=c(2.13)
(2.13)yz=c

Looking back at our table, we would again like to have achieved a |DAR|
of *39.445.* What *Average Daily Charge* would we have needed to achieve
this result?

NDiP
GCt
EARB
DARt
30
$131,440.30
$203,460.50

If we plug our known variables into our formula for *Average Daily
Charge*, we get an |ADC| of *$5,158.74*.

*EARB* (xx) divided by *DARt* (tt) = *ADC* (cc).

|203460.50 / 39.444|

//

|## [1] 5158.212|

As a change in |ADC| will effect |GCt|, we’ll use the |ADC|-centric
formula for |GCt| to calculate it, giving us *$154,746.36*.

*NDiP* (nn) multiplied by *ADC* (cc) = *GCt* (xx).

|30 * 5158.212|

//

|## [1] 154746.4|

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.5 ADC-Related Formulas// <#adc-related-formulas>

For completeness’ sake I’m going to include the formulas for |EARB|, |
NDiP|, and |GCt| that include the |ADC| variable (cc):


Where:   EARB=y  NDiP=n  GCt=x  ADC=c  DAR=z  Then:   z×c=yx÷c=nn×c=x(2.14)
(2.14)Where:   EARB=y  NDiP=n  GCt=x  ADC=c  DAR=z  Then:   z×c=yx÷c=nn×c=x

We’ll test these out to make sure everything’s in order:

NDiP
GCt
EARB
ADC
DAR
30
$131,440.30
$203,460.50
$4,381.34
46.44

*DAR* (zz) multiplied by *ADC* (cc) = *EARB* (yy).

|46.43793010499292 * 4381.343|

//

|## [1] 203460.5|

*GCt* (xx) divided by *ADC* (cc) = *NDiP* (nn).

|131440.30 / 4381.343|

//

|## [1] 30|

*NDiP* (nn) multiplied by *ADC* (cc) = *GCt* (xx).

|30 * 4381.343|

//

|## [1] 131440.3|


And, as you can see, everything adds up. One note is that you do want to
be mindful to include the entire number and every one of its decimals in
the calculations for accuracy, then round up afterwards. Hopefully by
now, you’re beginning to see some patterns emerging that begin to
illustrate the relationship between all of the variables that make up
the DAR calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2.4.6 Relationships Between the Variables// <#relationships-
      between-the-variables>

In this section, we will discuss the empirical relationship between |
DAR| and all of it’s related variables. In the last section, you might
have noticed that we established two different formulas for the *Average
Daily Charge*:


GCtNDiP=ADCEARBDAR=ADC(2.15)
GCtNDiP=ADC(2.15)EARBDAR=ADC


If these are both true, then we can assume that the following equations
are also true:


GCtNDiP=EARBDARDARNDiP=EARBGCtGCtEARB=NDiPDAR(2.15)
GCtNDiP=EARBDARDARNDiP=EARBGCt(2.15)GCtEARB=NDiPDAR


Or, in mathematical terms:

xn=yzzn=yxxy=nz(2.16)
xn=yzzn=yx(2.16)xy=nz


Let’s test these out with our original report values:

NDiP

$131,440.30
$203,460.50

//

|## [1] 4381.343|

*EARB* (yy) divided by *GCt* (xx) = the /Actual/ *EARB* Ratio

|203460.50 / 131440.30|

//

|## [1] 1.547931|

*DAR* (zz) divided by *NDiP* (nn) = the /Ideal/ *EARB* Ratio

|46.43793010499292 / 30|

//

|## [1] 1.547931|

*GCt* (xx) divided by *EARB* (yy) = the /Actual/ *GCt* Ratio

|131440.30 / 203460.50|

//

|## [1] 0.6460237|

*NDiP* (nn) divided by *DAR* (zz) = the /Ideal/ *GCt* Ratio

|30 / 46.43793010499292|

//

|## [1] 0.6460236|


Again, you’ll want to include all of the decimals in the calculation for
absolute accuracy, but:

 1.

    the *total Gross Charges* divided by the *Number of Days in the
    Period* is equal to the *Ending AR Balance* divided by the average
    *Days in AR*. Not only that,

 2.

    the average *Days in AR*. divided by the *Number of Days in the
    Period* is equal to the *Ending AR Balance* divided by the *total
    Gross Charges*.

This is an important fundamental relationship between these variables
called the *DAR Ratio* that we’ll explore in depth in the next chapter.
