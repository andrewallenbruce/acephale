    "text": "Overview\nThe Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code Set is an external, non-medical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the ASC X12N Health Care transactions, including those mandated under HIPAA.\nA taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length, that describes a health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization.\nTaxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. When providers apply for NPIs, the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) does not verify the accuracy of the selected taxonomy codes. It only validates that the codes exist within the current version of the code set.\nIt is important for healthcare providers to select the most appropriate taxonomy code(s) as it can affect various aspects of their practice, including billing and claims processing. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete."

This data includes the Medicare specialty codes, if available, provider/supplier type description, taxonomy code, and the taxonomy description.\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Footnote\n    \n\n\n1\nMedicare no longer enrolls this provider type.\n\n\n2\nThis is an arrangement whereby immunization services are rendered by health care providers who are under contract to the entity/individual who is enrolled in Medicare as a Mass Immunization Roster Biller. The Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code(s) would be that (those) of the health care provider(s) who render the immunization services.\n\n\n3\nMedicare carriers use Specialty Code 87 for Pharmacies when processing prescription drugs that are paid through the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. However, the description for Specialty Code 87 remains All Other Suppliers.\n\n\n4\nBecause the Medicare Provider Type Physician/Undefined Physician Type applies to physicians,Unknown Supplier/Provider Specialty applies to other than physicians. Because Medicare does not enroll every non-physician supplier/provider type in the Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code Set, we cannot arbitrarily link this Medicare Provider Type to all remaining supplier/provider types in the Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code Set. In truth, this Medicare Provider Type would link to every Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code (except those that describe physicians) that is listed in this document. We do not list them here because doing so would greatly increase the size of this document.\n\n\n5\nBecause the Medicare Provider Type indicates that the provider/supplier is a Physician, we have linked this to the most generic Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians classification. It could technically link to every Allopathic & Osteopathic Physician.\n\n\n6\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n7\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n8\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n9\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n10\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n11\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n12\nThere is no linkage to specific Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Codes because an Indian Health Service facility can be various provider types/classifications.\n\n\n13\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n14\nDoes not meet the definition of health care provider at 45 CFR 160.103 is not eligible for an NPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnote1\n      note2\n      \n        Medicare Specialty\n      \n      \n        Provider Taxonomy\n      \n    \n\nCode\n      Provider Type/Description\n      Code\n      Grouping\n      Classification\n      Specialization\n    \n\n\n\n—\n—\n01\nPhysician/General Practice\n208D00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nGeneral Practice\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208600000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086H0002X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nHospice and Palliative Medicine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0120X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nPediatric Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0122X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0105X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgery of the Hand\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0102X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgical Critical Care\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086X0206X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgical Oncology\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0127X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nTrauma Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0129X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nVascular Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208G00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nThoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery)\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n204F00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nTransplant Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208C00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nColon & Rectal Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207T00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nNeurological Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n204E00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOral & Maxillofacial Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207X00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0114X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nAdult Reconstructive Orthopedic Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0004X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nFoot and Ankle Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0106X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nHand Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0117X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nOrthopedic Surgery of the Spine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0801X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nOrthopedic Trauma\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XP3100X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nPediatric Orthopedic Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0005X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nSports Medicine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208200000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2082S0099X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\nPlastic Surgery Within the Head & Neck\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2082S0105X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\nSurgery of the Hand\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207K00000X \nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207KA0200X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\nAllergy\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207KI0005X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\nClinical & Laboratory Immunology\n\n\n—\n—\n04\nPhysician/Otolaryngology\n207Y00000X \nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\n Otolaryngology \n—"

The RVUs are used to calculate the payment amount for each service, while the GPCI is used to adjust the payment amount based on the location where the service is provided.\nThis file contains information on services covered by the MPFS in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated RVUs, a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).\nThe MPFS amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A GPCI has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedure’s RVU:\n\nPhysician Work\nPractice Expense\nMalpractice Expense (sometimes called Professional Liability Insurance)\n\nThe GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.\n\n x = [(RVU_w \\times GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\times GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\times GPCI_m)] \\times CF \n\n y = 0.95x \n\n z = 0.95(1.15x) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Ways to Say the Same Thing\n\n\n\n\nAs there is a corresponding GPCI value for each of the three components of an RVU, the formula is essentially the dot product of the RVU and GPCI vectors, multiplied by the conversion factor:\n\n a \\cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \nSetting up the variables:\n\nwrvu  = 6.26   # Work RVU\nwgpci = 1      # Work GPCI\n\npgpci = 0.883  # Practice GPCI\nprvu  = 4.36   # Practice RVU\n\nmrvu  = 0.99   # Malpractice RVU\nmgpci = 1.125  # Malpractice GPCI\n\ncf    = 32.744 # Conversion Factor\n\n\nBasic Calculation:\n\n((wrvu * wgpci) + \n   (prvu * pgpci) + \n   (mrvu * mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith base R’s Matrix Multiplication Infix Operator:\n\nas.vector(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu) %*% \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci) * cf)\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the pracma package’s dot() function:\n\npracma::dot(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu), \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the northstar package’s calculate_amounts() function:\n\ncalculate_amounts(\n  wrvu  = 6.26,\n  nprvu = 7.92,\n  fprvu = 4.36,\n  mrvu  = 0.99,\n  cf    = 32.744,\n  wgpci = 1,\n  pgpci = 0.883,\n  mgpci = 1.125\n)\n\nFacility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 11.22\nParticipating ........ $367.51\nNon-Particpating ..... $349.13\nLimiting Charge ...... $401.50\n\nNon-Facility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 14.37\nParticipating ........ $470.44\nNon-Particpating ..... $446.91\nLimiting Charge ...... $513.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Facility vs. Facility\n\n\n\nUnder the MPFS, many procedures have separate payment amounts for physician services when provided in facility and non-facility settings.\nThe amount is determined by the Place of Service (POS) code. In general, the POS code reflects the actual place where the patient receives the face-to-face service and determines whether the facility or non-facility payment rate is paid.\nServices rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face encounter with the patient occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapy Code Capitation\n\n\n\nCertain therapy codes will receive a 50% reduction to the Practice Expense.\nSection 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires a payment cap on the Technical Component (TC) of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services.\nThis cap is based on the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment. To implement this provision, the Physician Fee Schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and the lower amount is used in the formula to calculate payment.\n\n\n\nAccepting assignment means that a healthcare provider or facility is partnered with Medicare and is required by law to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for various services. This amount is preset by Medicare and is often less than many healthcare facilities would charge.\nBecause of this, when patients receive care at a facility that accepts assignment, they will be required to pay lower out-of-pocket costs as Medicare will cover the full amount of the service cost. Personal costs only include the premium and any charges up to the deductible amount.\nPhysicians or facilities that do not accept assignment are a non-participating providers. All physicians are required to file with Medicare, indicating that they either accept or do not accept assignment. If a provider does not accept assignment, it means that they are not required to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for services.\n\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\n\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at 115\\% of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at 95\\% of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating 95\\% of 115\\% of an amount, x, is equivalent to x \\times 1.0925 (or 109.25\\%):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# using the northstar package\nlimiting_charge(10)\n\n[1] 10.925\n\n\n\nThis file contains information on services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS).

    "text": "The MPFS is a listing of the relative value units (RVUs) for each CPT code, as well as the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for each code. The RVUs are used to calculate the payment amount for each service, while the GPCI is used to adjust the payment amount based on the location where the service is provided.\nThis file contains information on services covered by the MPFS in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated RVUs, a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).\nThe MPFS amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A GPCI has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedure’s RVU:\n\nPhysician Work\nPractice Expense\nMalpractice Expense (sometimes called Professional Liability Insurance)\n\nThe GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.\n\n x = [(RVU_w \\times GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\times GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\times GPCI_m)] \\times CF \n\n y = 0.95x \n\n z = 0.95(1.15x) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Ways to Say the Same Thing\n\n\n\n\nAs there is a corresponding GPCI value for each of the three components of an RVU, the formula is essentially the dot product of the RVU and GPCI vectors, multiplied by the conversion factor:\n\n a \\cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \nSetting up the variables:\n\nwrvu  = 6.26   # Work RVU\nwgpci = 1      # Work GPCI\n\npgpci = 0.883  # Practice GPCI\nprvu  = 4.36   # Practice RVU\n\nmrvu  = 0.99   # Malpractice RVU\nmgpci = 1.125  # Malpractice GPCI\n\ncf    = 32.744 # Conversion Factor\n\n\nBasic Calculation:\n\n((wrvu * wgpci) + \n   (prvu * pgpci) + \n   (mrvu * mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith base R’s Matrix Multiplication Infix Operator:\n\nas.vector(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu) %*% \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci) * cf)\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the pracma package’s dot() function:\n\npracma::dot(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu), \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the northstar package’s calculate_amounts() function:\n\ncalculate_amounts(\n  wrvu  = 6.26,\n  nprvu = 7.92,\n  fprvu = 4.36,\n  mrvu  = 0.99,\n  cf    = 32.744,\n  wgpci = 1,\n  pgpci = 0.883,\n  mgpci = 1.125\n)\n\nFacility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 11.22\nParticipating ........ $367.51\nNon-Particpating ..... $349.13\nLimiting Charge ...... $401.50\n\nNon-Facility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 14.37\nParticipating ........ $470.44\nNon-Particpating ..... $446.91\nLimiting Charge ...... $513.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Facility vs. Facility\n\n\n\nUnder the MPFS, many procedures have separate payment amounts for physician services when provided in facility and non-facility settings.\nThe amount is determined by the Place of Service (POS) code. In general, the POS code reflects the actual place where the patient receives the face-to-face service and determines whether the facility or non-facility payment rate is paid.\nServices rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face encounter with the patient occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapy Code Capitation\n\n\n\nCertain therapy codes will receive a 50% reduction to the Practice Expense.\nSection 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires a payment cap on the Technical Component (TC) of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services.\nThis cap is based on the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment. To implement this provision, the Physician Fee Schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and the lower amount is used in the formula to calculate payment."

    "text": "Accepting assignment means that a healthcare provider or facility is partnered with Medicare and is required by law to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for various services. This amount is preset by Medicare and is often less than many healthcare facilities would charge.\nBecause of this, when patients receive care at a facility that accepts assignment, they will be required to pay lower out-of-pocket costs as Medicare will cover the full amount of the service cost. Personal costs only include the premium and any charges up to the deductible amount.\nPhysicians or facilities that do not accept assignment are a non-participating providers. All physicians are required to file with Medicare, indicating that they either accept or do not accept assignment. If a provider does not accept assignment, it means that they are not required to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for services.\n\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\n\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at 115\\% of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at 95\\% of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating 95\\% of 115\\% of an amount, x, is equivalent to x \\times 1.0925 (or 109.25\\%):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# using the northstar package\nlimiting_charge(10)\n\n[1] 10.925"

    "text": "NPI Check Digit\nThe check digit is calculated using the Luhn formula for computing the modulus 10 double-add-double check digit.3\n3 This algorithm is recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 7812) and is the specified check digit algorithm to be used for the card issuer identifier on a standard health identification card.4 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812#Major_industry_identifier for further explanation.When an NPI is used as a card issuer identifier on a standard health identification card, it is prefixed with 80840, in which 80 indicates health applications and 840 indicates the United States4.\nTo enable this feature for any NPI, the check digit will always be calculated as if the prefix is present. For a non-prefixed NPI, this is accomplished by adding the constant 24 in step 2 of the calculation.\nCheck Digit Calculation\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\nBeginning with the rightmost digit, double the value of the alternate digits.\nAdd the individual digits of the products from Step 1 to the unaffected digits from the original number.\nSubtract the result of step 2 from the next highest number ending in zero. This is the check digit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Multiple of Ten\n\n\n\nThe next highest number ending in zero is the next multiple of ten.\nSpecifically, for some number n, the next multiple of ten would be n + (10 - (n \\mod 10)):\n\nnext_10 &lt;- \\(n) n + (10 - (n %% 10))\n\nFor example, if n is 23, the next multiple of ten is 30:\n\nnext_10(23)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nIf n is a multiple of ten, such as 50, the next multiple of 10 is 60:\n\nnext_10(50)\n\n[1] 60\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nThe following check digit calculation examples are reproduced from the CMS Standard document, which includes demonstrations for both prefixed and non-prefixed NPIs.\n\n\nPrefix\nNon-Prefix\n\n\n\n\nAssume the prefixed 9-position identifier is 80840123456789\n\n\nprefix_id &lt;- \\(x, y) {\n  as.integer(\n    unlist(\n      strsplit(\n        paste0(x, y), \"\")\n      )\n    )\n}\n\nx &lt;- prefix_id(80840, 123456789)\n\nx\n\n [1] 8 0 8 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\n\nBeginning on the right, double the alternate digits: 8 0 8 8 0 2 2 6 4 10 6 14 8 18\n\n\nreverse_double &lt;- \\(x) {\n  \n  x &lt;- rev(x)\n  \n  idx &lt;- seq(1, length(x), 2)\n  \n  x[idx] &lt;- x[idx] * 2\n  \n  rev(x)\n}\n\nx &lt;- reverse_double(x)\n\nx\n\n [1]  8  0  8  8  0  2  2  6  4 10  6 14  8 18\n\n\n\nSum the individual digits: 8 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 8 = 67\n\n\nadd_digits &lt;- \\(x) {\n  sum(\n    as.integer(\n      unlist(\n        strsplit(\n          as.character(x), \"\")\n        )\n      )\n    )\n}\n\nx &lt;- add_digits(x)\n\nx\n\n[1] 67\n\n\n\nSubtract the sum from the next multiple of 10.
