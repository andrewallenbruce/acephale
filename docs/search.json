    "text": "0.2 Overview\nThe Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code Set is an external, non-medical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the ASC X12N Health Care transactions, including those mandated under HIPAA.\nA taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length, that describes a health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization.\nTaxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. When providers apply for NPIs, the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) does not verify the accuracy of the selected taxonomy codes. It only validates that the codes exist within the current version of the code set.\nIt is important for healthcare providers to select the most appropriate taxonomy code(s) as it can affect various aspects of their practice, including billing and claims processing. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete."

This data includes the Medicare specialty codes, if available, provider/supplier type description, taxonomy code, and the taxonomy description.\nFootnotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Footnote\n    \n\n\n1\nMedicare no longer enrolls this provider type.\n\n\n2\nThis is an arrangement whereby immunization services are rendered by health care providers who are under contract to the entity/individual who is enrolled in Medicare as a Mass Immunization Roster Biller. The Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code(s) would be that (those) of the health care provider(s) who render the immunization services.\n\n\n3\nMedicare carriers use Specialty Code 87 for Pharmacies when processing prescription drugs that are paid through the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. However, the description for Specialty Code 87 remains All Other Suppliers.\n\n\n4\nBecause the Medicare Provider Type Physician/Undefined Physician Type applies to physicians,Unknown Supplier/Provider Specialty applies to other than physicians. Because Medicare does not enroll every non-physician supplier/provider type in the Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code Set, we cannot arbitrarily link this Medicare Provider Type to all remaining supplier/provider types in the Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code Set. In truth, this Medicare Provider Type would link to every Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Code (except those that describe physicians) that is listed in this document. We do not list them here because doing so would greatly increase the size of this document.\n\n\n5\nBecause the Medicare Provider Type indicates that the provider/supplier is a Physician, we have linked this to the most generic Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians classification. It could technically link to every Allopathic & Osteopathic Physician.\n\n\n6\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n7\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n8\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n9\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n10\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n11\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n12\nThere is no linkage to specific Healthcare Provider Taxonomy Codes because an Indian Health Service facility can be various provider types/classifications.\n\n\n13\nMedicare specialty code designation is for Part B DMEPOS purposes.\n\n\n14\nDoes not meet the definition of health care provider at 45 CFR 160.103 is not eligible for an NPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnote1\n      note2\n      \n        Medicare Specialty\n      \n      \n        Provider Taxonomy\n      \n    \n\nCode\n      Provider Type/Description\n      Code\n      Grouping\n      Classification\n      Specialization\n    \n\n\n\n—\n—\n01\nPhysician/General Practice\n208D00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nGeneral Practice\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208600000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086H0002X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nHospice and Palliative Medicine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0120X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nPediatric Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0122X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0105X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgery of the Hand\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0102X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgical Critical Care\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086X0206X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nSurgical Oncology\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0127X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nTrauma Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2086S0129X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nSurgery\nVascular Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208G00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nThoracic Surgery (Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery)\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n204F00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nTransplant Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208C00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nColon & Rectal Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207T00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nNeurological Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n204E00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOral & Maxillofacial Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207X00000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0114X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nAdult Reconstructive Orthopedic Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0004X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nFoot and Ankle Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0106X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nHand Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XS0117X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nOrthopedic Surgery of the Spine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0801X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nOrthopedic Trauma\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XP3100X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nPediatric Orthopedic Surgery\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n207XX0005X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nOrthopedic Surgery\nSports Medicine\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n208200000X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2082S0099X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\nPlastic Surgery Within the Head & Neck\n\n\n—\n—\n02\nPhysician/General Surgery\n2082S0105X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nPlastic Surgery\nSurgery of the Hand\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207K00000X \nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\n—\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207KA0200X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\nAllergy\n\n\n—\n—\n03\nPhysician/Allergy/ Immunology\n207KI0005X\nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\nAllergy and Immunology\nClinical & Laboratory Immunology\n\n\n—\n—\n04\nPhysician/Otolaryngology\n207Y00000X \nAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians\n Otolaryngology \n—"

    "text": "1.2 NPI Check Digit\nThe check digit is calculated using the Luhn formula for computing the modulus 10 double-add-double check digit.3\n3 This algorithm is recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 7812) and is the specified check digit algorithm to be used for the card issuer identifier on a standard health identification card.When an NPI is used as a card issuer identifier on a standard health identification card, it is prefixed with 80840, in which 80 indicates health applications and 840 indicates the United States. To enable this feature for any NPI, the check digit will always be calculated as if the prefix is present. For a non-prefixed NPI, this is accomplished by adding the constant 24 in step 2 of the calculation.\nCheck Digit Calculation\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\nBeginning with the rightmost digit, double the value of the alternate digits.\nAdd the individual digits of the products from Step 1 to the unaffected digits from the original number.\nSubtract the result of step 2 from the next highest number ending in zero. This is the check digit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Multiple of Ten\n\n\n\nThe next highest number ending in zero is the next multiple of ten.\nSpecifically, for some number n, the next multiple of ten would be n + (10 - (n \\mod 10)):\n\nnext_10 &lt;- \\(n) n + (10 - (n %% 10))\n\nFor example, if n is 23, the next multiple of ten is 30:\n\nnext_10(23)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nIf n is a multiple of ten, such as 50, the next multiple of 10 is 60:\n\nnext_10(50)\n\n[1] 60\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nThe following check digit calculation examples are reproduced from the CMS Standard document, which includes demonstrations for both prefixed and non-prefixed NPIs.\n\n\nPrefix\nNon-Prefix\n\n\n\n\nAssume the prefixed 9-position identifier is:\n\n\n(y &lt;- as.integer(splitter(\"80840123456789\")))\n\n [1] 8 0 8 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n\n\nprefix_id &lt;- \\(x) {\n  as.integer(\n    unlist(\n      strsplit(\n        paste0(80840, x), \"\")\n      )\n    )\n}\n\n(x &lt;- prefix_id(123456789))\n\n [1] 8 0 8 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nall.equal(x, y)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nBeginning on the right, double the alternate digits: 8 0 8 8 0 2 2 6 4 10 6 14 8 18\n\n\nreverse_double &lt;- \\(x) {\n  \n  x &lt;- rev(x)\n  \n  idx &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)\n  \n  x[idx] &lt;- x[idx] * 2\n  \n  rev(x)\n}\n\nx &lt;- reverse_double(x)\n\nx\n\n [1]  8  0  8  8  0  2  2  6  4 10  6 14  8 18\n\n\n\nSum the individual digits: 8 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 8 = 67\n\n\nadd_digits &lt;- \\(x) {\n  sum(\n    as.integer(\n      unlist(\n        strsplit(\n          as.character(x), \"\")\n        )\n      )\n    )\n}\n\nx &lt;- add_digits(x)\n\nx\n\n[1] 67\n\n\n\nSubtract the sum from the next multiple of 10.

    "text": "Average Days in Accounts Receivable (DAR or Average Days in AR) is a common financial metric known as an efficiency ratio.\nDAR measures the average number of days it takes for a business to collect money owed for services rendered from the responsible parties.\nIts function in the healthcare revenue cycle is as a high-level monitor of the financial health of a healthcare entity.\nThe following is a thorough overview of everything you never knew you didn’t want to know about DAR. Let’s start off with some background and terminology. See Note 1 for more information on the American healthcare economic model.\n\nAging of Accounts\n\nAn account is a billable episode of care. It begins to age once it is billed to the guarantor. These outstanding accounts are monitored in 30-day blocks or bins ([0, 30), [31, 60), [61, 90), [91, 120), and [121, \\infty)) by the number of accounts, the amount owed by each bin and the responsible parties. The older the account, the less likely it will be paid.\n\n\n\n\nGuarantor\n\nThe responsible party for the amount owed (an insurance payer, a patient, etc.) Most claims are originally billed to insurance and, until the insurance makes a payment, the responsibility for the payment continues to be with the insurance payer. After the payer makes or denies a payment (with no just cause for an appeal), the responsibility for the balance of goes to the patient (to be sent an invoice) or the physician (to be written off.)\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAR represents money owed to the healthcare practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The AR balance is the total charges billed to an insurance payer or patient for services rendered but not yet collected. The balance can only be reduced by payment or by adjustments, contractual or otherwise. The AR cycle begins with the delivery of services and ends with reconciliation, or when the balance owed equals zero.\n\nAverage Days in AR\n\nA mathematical formula for the average number of days it takes a business to collect money that it is owed. A low average is good. A high average signals a problem within the revenue cycle.\n\n\n\nSo now we know that a low Days in AR number is good and a high number is bad. How low is good though? How high is bad?\nLet’s say that a practice has a DAR of 95 days. This means that, on average, it takes the practice 95 days to collect it’s outstanding balances. Let’s start with what we can say for sure about a Days in AR of 95:\n\n95 days is roughly equal to a little over three months.\nTherefore, there is three months of unpaid work sitting in Accounts Receivable.\nAs such, this practice will need three months of cash reserves on hand to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThe ideal Days in AR depends entirely upon the medical practice, its customers (patients), its customers’ payers, the services it supplies, the providers performing those services, and the financial situation of the practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: The American Healthcare Economic Model\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the healthcare version of Days in AR, you need to first understand the environment in which it is used.\nTypically, companies sell their products or services directly to consumers and are paid immediately at the point of service (POS). This is called a business-to-consumer revenue model.\nAnother revenue model type is the business-to-business (B2B) model, concerning businesses that transact primarily with each other. Purchases between two businesses tend to be much larger. As such, B2B businesses invoice on a monthly basis, meaning no payment for 30+ days.\nSomewhere in between these two models is the American healthcare system. This gray area is caused by a middleman called a third party payer. Better known as an insurance company, providers enter into a contractual agreement with this third party to be paid for their services at a reduced rate.\nIn exchange, a provider gains access to the payer’s large subscriber base. The difference between the charge a provider submits to a payer and the contracted rate he or she has agreed to is called the contractual adjustment, which is written off once a claim has been adjudicated.\nThe contractual adjustment introduces a critical inefficiency to the healthcare revenue model. Rather than prices being determined by supply and demand, they are set by individually negotiated arrangements, the end result of which is no real demand or pricing curve.\nThis issue is much too complex for me to properly do justice to here. It is, however, an essential concept to grasp when trying to understand healthcare reimbursement. In other words, healthcare reimbursement is crazy, not you.\n\n\n\n\n\n \\overline{dar} = \\ earb \\div (\\ gc \\ \\div \\ n_{days}\\ )\\ \n\n \\overline{dar_t} = \\frac{arb_t}{gc_t\\div n_{days}} \nWhere:\nt = \\text{Time Period} The subscript t denotes the time period being measured.\nn_{days} = \\text{Days in Period} The number of days in t.\ngc_t = \\text{Gross Charges} The sum of all charges billed during t.\n\\overline{dc_t} = \\text{Average Daily Charge} gc_t divided by n_{days}.\narb_t = \\text{AR Balance} The sum of all outstanding balances at close of business (COB) on the final day of t.\n\\overline{dar_t} = \\text{Average Days in AR} arb_t divided by \\overline{dc_t} for time period t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2: Example in R\n\n\n\nLet’s say we want to calculate \\overline{dar_t} for the current month.

The RVUs are used to calculate the payment amount for each service, while the GPCI is used to adjust the payment amount based on the location where the service is provided.\nThis file contains information on services covered by the MPFS in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated RVUs, a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).\nThe MPFS amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A GPCI has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedure’s RVU:\n\nPhysician Work\nPractice Expense\nMalpractice Expense (sometimes called Professional Liability Insurance)\n\nThe GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.\n\n x = [(RVU_w \\times GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\times GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\times GPCI_m)] \\times CF \n\n y = 0.95x \n\n z = 0.95(1.15x) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Ways to Say the Same Thing\n\n\n\n\nAs there is a corresponding GPCI value for each of the three components of an RVU, the formula is essentially the dot product of the RVU and GPCI vectors, multiplied by the conversion factor:\n\n a \\cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \nSetting up the variables:\n\nwrvu  = 6.26   # Work RVU\nwgpci = 1      # Work GPCI\n\npgpci = 0.883  # Practice GPCI\nprvu  = 4.36   # Practice RVU\n\nmrvu  = 0.99   # Malpractice RVU\nmgpci = 1.125  # Malpractice GPCI\n\ncf    = 32.744 # Conversion Factor\n\n\nBasic Calculation:\n\n((wrvu * wgpci) + \n   (prvu * pgpci) + \n   (mrvu * mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith base R’s Matrix Multiplication Infix Operator:\n\nas.vector(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu) %*% \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci) * cf)\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the pracma package’s dot() function:\n\npracma::dot(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu), \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the northstar package’s calculate_amounts() function:\n\ncalculate_amounts(\n  wrvu  = 6.26,\n  nprvu = 7.92,\n  fprvu = 4.36,\n  mrvu  = 0.99,\n  cf    = 32.744,\n  wgpci = 1,\n  pgpci = 0.883,\n  mgpci = 1.125\n)\n\nFacility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 11.22\nParticipating ........ $367.51\nNon-Particpating ..... $349.13\nLimiting Charge ...... $401.50\n\nNon-Facility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 14.37\nParticipating ........ $470.44\nNon-Particpating ..... $446.91\nLimiting Charge ...... $513.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Facility vs. Facility\n\n\n\nUnder the MPFS, many procedures have separate payment amounts for physician services when provided in facility and non-facility settings.\nThe amount is determined by the Place of Service (POS) code. In general, the POS code reflects the actual place where the patient receives the face-to-face service and determines whether the facility or non-facility payment rate is paid.\nServices rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face encounter with the patient occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapy Code Capitation\n\n\n\nCertain therapy codes will receive a 50% reduction to the Practice Expense.\nSection 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires a payment cap on the Technical Component (TC) of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services.\nThis cap is based on the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment. To implement this provision, the Physician Fee Schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and the lower amount is used in the formula to calculate payment.\n\n\n\nAccepting assignment means that a healthcare provider or facility is partnered with Medicare and is required by law to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for various services. This amount is preset by Medicare and is often less than many healthcare facilities would charge.\nBecause of this, when patients receive care at a facility that accepts assignment, they will be required to pay lower out-of-pocket costs as Medicare will cover the full amount of the service cost. Personal costs only include the premium and any charges up to the deductible amount.\nPhysicians or facilities that do not accept assignment are a non-participating providers. All physicians are required to file with Medicare, indicating that they either accept or do not accept assignment. If a provider does not accept assignment, it means that they are not required to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for services.\n\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\n\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at 115\\% of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at 95\\% of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating 95\\% of 115\\% of an amount, x, is equivalent to x \\times 1.0925 (or 109.25\\%):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# using the northstar package\nlimiting_charge(10)\n\n[1] 10.925\n\n\n\nThis file contains information on services covered by the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS).

    "text": "The MPFS is a listing of the relative value units (RVUs) for each CPT code, as well as the geographic practice cost index (GPCI) for each code. The RVUs are used to calculate the payment amount for each service, while the GPCI is used to adjust the payment amount based on the location where the service is provided.\nThis file contains information on services covered by the MPFS in 2024. For more than 10,000 physician services, the file contains the associated RVUs, a fee schedule status indicator, and various payment policy indicators needed for payment adjustment (i.e., payment of assistant at surgery, team surgery, bilateral surgery, etc.).\nThe MPFS amounts are adjusted to reflect the variation in practice costs from area to area. A GPCI has been established for every Medicare payment locality for each of the three components of a procedure’s RVU:\n\nPhysician Work\nPractice Expense\nMalpractice Expense (sometimes called Professional Liability Insurance)\n\nThe GPCIs are applied in the calculation of a fee schedule payment amount by multiplying the RVU for each component times the GPCI for that component.\n\n x = [(RVU_w \\times GPCI_w) + (RVU_p \\times GPCI_p) + (RVU_m \\times GPCI_m)] \\times CF \n\n y = 0.95x \n\n z = 0.95(1.15x) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Ways to Say the Same Thing\n\n\n\n\nAs there is a corresponding GPCI value for each of the three components of an RVU, the formula is essentially the dot product of the RVU and GPCI vectors, multiplied by the conversion factor:\n\n a \\cdot b = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \nSetting up the variables:\n\nwrvu  = 6.26   # Work RVU\nwgpci = 1      # Work GPCI\n\npgpci = 0.883  # Practice GPCI\nprvu  = 4.36   # Practice RVU\n\nmrvu  = 0.99   # Malpractice RVU\nmgpci = 1.125  # Malpractice GPCI\n\ncf    = 32.744 # Conversion Factor\n\n\nBasic Calculation:\n\n((wrvu * wgpci) + \n   (prvu * pgpci) + \n   (mrvu * mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith base R’s Matrix Multiplication Infix Operator:\n\nas.vector(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu) %*% \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci) * cf)\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the pracma package’s dot() function:\n\npracma::dot(\n  c(wrvu, prvu, mrvu), \n  c(wgpci, pgpci, mgpci)) * cf\n\n[1] 367.5065\n\n\n\nWith the northstar package’s calculate_amounts() function:\n\ncalculate_amounts(\n  wrvu  = 6.26,\n  nprvu = 7.92,\n  fprvu = 4.36,\n  mrvu  = 0.99,\n  cf    = 32.744,\n  wgpci = 1,\n  pgpci = 0.883,\n  mgpci = 1.125\n)\n\nFacility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 11.22\nParticipating ........ $367.51\nNon-Particpating ..... $349.13\nLimiting Charge ...... $401.50\n\nNon-Facility Amounts:\n\nRVU Total ............ 14.37\nParticipating ........ $470.44\nNon-Particpating ..... $446.91\nLimiting Charge ...... $513.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Facility vs. Facility\n\n\n\nUnder the MPFS, many procedures have separate payment amounts for physician services when provided in facility and non-facility settings.\nThe amount is determined by the Place of Service (POS) code. In general, the POS code reflects the actual place where the patient receives the face-to-face service and determines whether the facility or non-facility payment rate is paid.\nServices rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face encounter with the patient occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapy Code Capitation\n\n\n\nCertain therapy codes will receive a 50% reduction to the Practice Expense.\nSection 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires a payment cap on the Technical Component (TC) of certain diagnostic imaging procedures and the TC portions of the global diagnostic imaging services.\nThis cap is based on the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) payment. To implement this provision, the Physician Fee Schedule amount is compared to the OPPS payment amount and the lower amount is used in the formula to calculate payment."

    "text": "Accepting assignment means that a healthcare provider or facility is partnered with Medicare and is required by law to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for various services. This amount is preset by Medicare and is often less than many healthcare facilities would charge.\nBecause of this, when patients receive care at a facility that accepts assignment, they will be required to pay lower out-of-pocket costs as Medicare will cover the full amount of the service cost. Personal costs only include the premium and any charges up to the deductible amount.\nPhysicians or facilities that do not accept assignment are a non-participating providers. All physicians are required to file with Medicare, indicating that they either accept or do not accept assignment. If a provider does not accept assignment, it means that they are not required to charge only the Medicare-approved amount for services.\n\nOne possible option for non-participating providers is to choose to accept assignment for some services but to decline assignment for others. For services that they accept assignment for, they are only able to bill the Medicare-approved amount. However, for other services, they are allowed to charge up to 15 percent more than the Medicare-approved amount.\nThis limit cap is known as the limiting charge. Providers that do not fully participate only receive 95 percent of the Medicare-approved amount when Medicare reimburses them for the cost of care. In turn, the provider can charge the patient up to 15 percent more than this reimbursement amount. This extra charge will not be covered by Medicare, which causes Medicare recipients to incur greater out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicare limiting charge is the maximum amount a Non-Participating Provider can charge for services submitted on a non-assigned claim. This is that maximum amount a beneficiary could legally be charged.\n\nThe Medicare limiting charge is, by law, set at 115\\% of the payment amount for the service furnished by the Non-Participating Physician.\nHowever, the law sets the payment amount for Non-Participating Physicians at 95\\% of the payment amount for Participating Physicians (i.e., the Fee Schedule amount).\nCalculating 95\\% of 115\\% of an amount, x, is equivalent to x \\times 1.0925 (or 109.25\\%):\n\n# 95% of 115% of 10\n(10 * 1.15) * 0.95 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# 109.25% of 10\n10 * 1.0925 \n\n[1] 10.925\n\n# using the northstar package\nlimiting_charge(10)\n\n[1] 10.925"

Indeed, economists are just as likely to say “with probability 1” as they are to say “with a 100% probability.”\nIt turns out that natural logarithms (“ln” or “log”) are the perfect way to think about percent changes. Suppose a variable X has a “before” and an “after” value.\n\nI want to take the point of view that the change in the natural logarithm is the pure, Platonic percent change between before and after. It is calculated as the natural logarithm of Xafter minus the natural logarithm of Xbefore.\nI will call the ordinary notion of percent change the earthly percent change. It is calculated as the change divided by the starting value, (Xafter - Xbefore)/Xbefore.\nIn between these two concepts is the midpoint percent change. It is calculated as the change divided by the average of the starting and ending values: ( new - old ) / (( new + old ) / 2 )\n\n\nplatonic_change = \\(old, new) {\n  log(new) - log(old)\n}\n\nearthly_change = \\(old, new) {\n  (new - old) / old\n}\n\nmidpoint_change = \\(old, new) {\n  (new - old) / ((new + old) / 2)\n}\n\nplatonic_change(old = 1, new = 5) * 100\n\n[1] 160.9438\n\nmidpoint_change(old = 1, new = 5) * 100\n\n[1] 133.3333\n\nearthly_change(old = 1, new = 5) * 100\n\n[1] 400\n\n\nFormally, that’s because of these limits: lim_{x rightarrow infty} {(x-1) over {(x+1)/2}} = 2\nlim_{x rightarrow infty} {(0-x) over {(x+0)/2}} = -2\nBelow is a table showing the relationship between Platonic percent changes, midpoint percent changes and earthly percent changes. In financial terms, one can think of earthly percentage changes as “continuously compounded” versions of Platonic percent changes:\n\nex &lt;- dplyr::tibble(\n  platonic = pct$platonic,\n  midpoint = 200 * (exp(platonic / 100) - 1) / (exp(platonic / 100) + 1),\n  earthly = 100 * exp(platonic / 100) - 100,\n  ratio = exp(platonic / 100)\n)\n\nex |&gt; \n  filter(platonic &gt;= 0) |&gt; \n  print(n = 20)\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n   platonic midpoint earthly ratio\n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        0     0       0     1   \n 2        5     5.00    5.13  1.05\n 3       10     9.99   10.5   1.11\n 4       15    15.0    16.2   1.16\n 5       20    19.9    22.1   1.22\n 6       25    24.9    28.4   1.28\n 7       30    29.8    35.0   1.35\n 8       40    39.5    49.2   1.49\n 9       50    49.0    64.9   1.65\n10       60    58.3    82.2   1.82\n11       70    67.3   101.    2.01\n12       80    76.0   123.    2.23\n13       90    84.4   146.    2.46\n14      100    92.4   172.    2.72\n15      140   121.    306.    4.06\n16      210   156.    717.    8.17\n17      280   177.   1544.   16.4 \n18      350   188.   3212.   33.1 \n19      420   194.   6569.   66.7 \n\n\nThere are at least two things to point out in this table:\n\nWhen the percent changes are small, all three concepts are fairly close, but the midpoint percent change is much closer to the Platonic (logarithmic) percent change.\nA 70% Platonic percent change is very close to being a doubling–which would be a 100% earthly percent change. This is where the “rule of 70” comes from. The rule of 70 is a reflection of the natural logarithm of 2 being equal to approximately .7 = 70%. Similarly, a 140% Platonic percent change is basically two doublings–that is, it is close to multiplying X by a factor of 4; and a 210% Platonic percent change is basically three doublings–that is, it is close to multiplying X by a factor of 8.\n\nLet’s look at negative percent changes as well. Here is the table for how the different concepts of negative percent changes compare:\n\nex |&gt; \n  filter(platonic &lt;= 0) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(platonic)) |&gt;\n  print(n = 20)\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n   platonic midpoint earthly  ratio\n      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        0     0       0    1     \n 2       -5    -5.00   -4.88 0.951 \n 3      -10    -9.99   -9.52 0.905 \n 4      -15   -15.0   -13.9  0.861 \n 5      -20   -19.9   -18.1  0.819 \n 6      -25   -24.9   -22.1  0.779 \n 7      -30   -29.8   -25.9  0.741 \n 8      -40   -39.5   -33.0  0.670 \n 9      -50   -49.0   -39.3  0.607 \n10      -60   -58.3   -45.1  0.549 \n11      -70   -67.3   -50.3  0.497 \n12      -80   -76.0   -55.1  0.449 \n13      -90   -84.4   -59.3  0.407 \n14     -100   -92.4   -63.2  0.368 \n15     -140  -121.    -75.3  0.247 \n16     -210  -156.    -87.8  0.122 \n17     -280  -177.    -93.9  0.0608\n18     -350  -188.    -97.0  0.0302\n19     -420  -194.    -98.5  0.0150\n\n\nA key point to make is that with both Platonic (logarithmic) percent changes and midpoint percent changes, equal sized changes of opposite direction cancel each other out. For example, a +50% Platonic percent change, followed by a -50% Platonic percent change, would leave things back where they started. This is true for a +50% midpoint percent change, followed by a -50% midpoint percent change. But, starting from X, a 50% earthly percent change leads to 1.5 X. Following that by a -50% earthly percent change leads to a result of .75 X, which is not at all where things started. This is a very ugly feature of earthly percent changes. That ugliness is one good reason to rise up to the Platonic level, or at least the midpoint level.\nContinuous-Time Growth Rates. There are many wonderful things about Platonic percent changes that I can’t go into without breaking my resolve to keep the equation count down. But one of the most wonderful is that to find a growth rate one only has to divide by the time that has elapsed between Xbefore and Xafter. That is, as long as one is using the Platonic percent change %ΔX=log(Xafter)-log(Xbefore),\n%ΔX / [time elapsed] = growth rate.\nThe growth rate here is technically called a “continuous-time growth rate.” The continuous-time growth rate is not only very useful, it is a thing of great beauty.\nUpdate on How the Different Concepts of Percent Change Relate to Each Other. One of my students asked about how the different percent change concepts relate to each other. For that, I need some equations. And I need “exp” which is the opposite of the natural logarithm “log.” Taking the function exp(X) is the same as taking e, (a number that is famous among mathematicians and equal to 2.718…) to the power X. For the equations below, it is crucial to treat % as another name for 1/100, so that, for example, 5% is the same thing as .05.\nEarthly percent changes are the most familiar. Almost anyone other than an economist who talks about percent changes is talking about earthly percent changes. Most of you learned about earthly percent changes in elementary school. So let me first write down how to get from the earthly percent change to the Platonic and midpoint percent changes. (I won’t try to prove these equations here, just state them.)\n\nearthly_to_platonic = \\(earthly) log(1 + earthly)\n\nearthly_to_midpoint = \\(earthly) (2 * earthly) / (2 + earthly)\n\nIf you are trying to figure out the effects of continuously compounded interest, or the effects of some other continuous-time growth rate, you will want to be able go from Platonic percent changes–which come straight from multiplying the growth rate by the amount of elapsed time–to earthly percent changes. For good measure, I will include the formula for midpoint percent changes as well:\n\nplatonic_to_earthly = \\(platonic) exp(platonic) - 1\n\nplatonic_to_midpoint = \\(platonic) (2 * (exp(platonic) - 1)) / (exp(platonic) + 1)\n\nI found the function giving the midpoint percent change as a function of the Platonic percent change quite intriguing. For one thing, when I changed signs and put “-Platonic” in the place where you see “Platonic” on the right-hand side of the equation the result equal to -midpoint. When switching the sign of the argument (the inside thing: Platonic) just switches the sign of the overall expression, mathematicians call it an “odd” function (“odd” as in “odd and even” not “odd” as in “strange”). The meaning of this function being odd is that Platonic and midpoint percent changes map into each other the same way for negative changes as for positive changes. (That isn’t true at all for the earthly percent changes.) The other intriguing thing about the function giving the midpoint percent change as a function of the Platonic percent change is how close it is to giving back the same number. To a fourth-order (the squared term and the fourth power term are zero), the approximation for the function is this:\n\n# midpoint = platonic - (platonic^3 / 12) + (5th power and higher terms)\n\nmidpoint_to_earthly = \\(midpoint) (2 * midpoint) / (2 - midpoint)\n\nmidpoint_to_platonic = \\(midpoint) log(2 + midpoint) - log(2 - midpoint)\n\nmidpoint_to_platonic2 = \\(midpoint) log(1 + (midpoint / 2)) - log(1 - (midpoint / 2))\n\n\n\n1 Session Information\n\n\n═ Session info ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n bit           4.5.0   2024-09-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n bit64         4.5.2   2024-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n cli           3.6.3   2024-06-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n colorspace    2.1-1   2024-07-26 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n crayon        1.5.3   2024-06-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n digest        0.6.37  2024-08-19 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n dplyr       * 1.1.4   2023-11-17 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n evaluate      1.0.1   2024-10-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n fansi         1.0.6   2023-12-08 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n fastmap       1.2.0   2024-05-15 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n forcats     * 1.0.0   2023-01-29 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n fuimus      * 0.0.2   2024-10-15 [1] local\n generics      0.1.3   2022-07-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n ggplot2     * 3.5.1   2024-04-23 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n glue          1.8.0   2024-09-30 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n gtable        0.3.5   2024-04-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n here        * 1.0.1   2020-12-13 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n hms           1.1.3   2023-03-21 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n htmltools     0.5.8.1 2024-04-04 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.6.4   2023-12-06 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n jsonlite      1.8.9   2024-09-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n knitr         1.48    2024-07-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n lifecycle     1.0.4   2023-11-07 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n lubridate   * 1.9.3   2023-09-27 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n magrittr      2.0.3   2022-03-30 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n munsell       0.5.1   2024-04-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n pillar        1.9.0   2023-03-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n pkgconfig     2.0.3   2019-09-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n purrr       * 1.0.2   2023-08-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n R6            2.5.1   2021-08-19 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n ragg          1.3.3   2024-09-11 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n readr       * 2.1.5   2024-01-10 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n rlang         1.1.4   2024-06-04 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n rmarkdown     2.28    2024-08-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.4.1)\n rprojroot     2.0.4   2023-11-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n rstudioapi    0.17.0  2024-10-16 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n scales        1.3.0   2023-11-28 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n stringi       1.8.4   2024-05-06 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n stringr     * 1.5.1   2023-11-14 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n systemfonts   1.1.0   2024-05-15 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n textshaping   0.4.0   2024-05-24 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n tibble      * 3.2.1   2023-03-20 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n tidyr       * 1.3.1   2024-01-24 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n tidyselect    1.2.1   2024-03-11 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n tidyverse   * 2.0.0   2023-02-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n timechange    0.3.0   2024-01-18 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n tzdb          0.4.0   2023-05-12 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n utf8          1.2.4   2023-10-22 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n vctrs         0.6.5   2023-12-01 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n vroom         1.6.5   2023-12-05 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n withr         3.0.1   2024-07-31 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n xfun          0.48    2024-10-03 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n yaml          2.3.10  2024-07-26 [1] RSPM (R 4.4.0)\n\n [1] C:/Users/Andrew/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.4\n [2] C:/Program Files/R/R-4.4.1/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{allen_bruce2024,\n  author = {Allen Bruce, Andrew},\n  title = {100\\%},\n  date = {2024-09-23},\n  url = {https://andrewallenbruce.github.io/acephale/posts/percent/percent.html},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAllen Bruce, Andrew. 2024. “100%.” September 23, 2024. https://andrewallenbruce.github.io/acephale/posts/percent/percent.html."
