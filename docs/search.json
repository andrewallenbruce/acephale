    "text": "Overview\nThe Health Care Provider Taxonomy Code Set is an external, non-medical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the ASC X12N Health Care transactions. This includes those mandated under HIPAA.\nA taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length.\nThe code set is structured into 3 distinct levels:\n\nProvider Grouping\nClassification\nArea of Specialization\n\nA taxonomy code describes a health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization. The primary specialty for this provider is indicated as “Primary”.\nTaxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. When providers apply for NPIs, the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) does not verify the accuracy of the selected taxonomy codes. It only validates that the codes exist within the current version of the code set.\nIt is important for healthcare providers to select the most appropriate taxonomy code(s) as it can affect various aspects of their practice, including billing and claims processing. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete."
